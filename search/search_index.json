Ask insightful and probing questions. Run experiments to test the actual buying behavior of a customer. These techniques can help you predict prices, unit volume, the length of the sales cycle, the timing and magnitude of revenue, and the cost of generating sales. Too many would-be entrepreneurs believe, \\\"If I build it, they will come.\\\" Following this self-centered strategy yields a high probability of pouring lots of money into a dark hole. A master entrepreneur takes every opportunity to observe the buying habits of potential customers and tries to form hypotheses about their motives. This leads to questions that help you dig more deeply into the emotions and habits that drive buying behavior. Even carefully crafted and deeply probing questions have their limits. Some customers refuse to tell you the truth. Others change their minds. Many cannot articulate why they buy what they do. The best way to get inside a customer\\'s shoes is to design experiments that help you predict buyer behavior before you sink large amounts of money into irretrievable investments such as factories or direct sales forces. Observe. Draw conclusions. Question. Refine your theories. Run experiments. Do more of what works. Do all of these before you make large commitments of time and money. At its essence, this is what bootstrapping entrepreneurship is all about: adding value, one customer at a time. []{#_Toc9463687 .anchor}[The Art of Haggling]{.underline} Practice RLC: Rat Like Cunning: Practice Ferreting Out Self-Interest : Promise yourself that, in the next fifty encounters, you will ask questions until you have uncovered someone's real self-interest in a decision Practice Being Told \"No\" : Just start selling. Once you've been told \"no\" a hundred times while selling door-to-door, the hundred and first time won't hurt as much. Practice Haggling : How do you become a master haggler? Next time you are in a store, just ask: \"Is that the best you can do?\" Pause. Don't say a word. Once you get an answer, repeat the question with more emphasis. Practice Not Paying Cash : This one is a little harder to practice But gather up some things you don't want and head for a flea market. Spend a few hours finding things you like better than what you have, and try to negotiate a trade. Practice Limiting your Downside and Picking up Free Options : Begin looking for opportunities to trade away risks to people who would rather bear them. Then ask for free options Practice Being Skeptical : Next time you are tempted to take a position based on emotion, pause. Suspend judgment. Ask \"why?\" the person is taking a position. Listen. Request concrete evidence, then ask \"why?\" again and again as you drill towards the truth. []{#_Toc9463688 .anchor}[Getting Inside the Mind of Your Customer]{.underline} Q: How do actual customers make decisions to buy a product or service? A: They seldom make decisions on reason alone and are often emotionally swayed. []{#_Toc9463689 .anchor}[Observing Customer Behavior]{.underline} []{#_Toc9463690 .anchor}[Dealing with Competition]{.underline} Moral of the story: competition will arrive. Sooner than you think. That\\'s the nature of creative destruction and a free economy. The game is won through trial and error, one small operation experiment at a time. Rarely you'll see a way to change the entire competitive game, and build something even larger and more profitable. []{#_Toc9463691 .anchor}[Targeting the Right Customers]{.underline} When we talk about \"targeting,\" we're still talking about grouping customers, but as a trial and error\" process, using a customer-by-customer series of experiments carried out by the sales department, carefully observing how and why customers buy, and creating provisional segmenting categories. The ability to target the most attractive customers first, while efficiently expanding production capacity at the lowest risk possible, is one of the most important skills for any entrepreneur. There is little \"science\" to targeting. Rather, it is an art. You must observe and unearth needs, perform small experiments, and use these to correlate observable traits with unobservable internal needs, so that your business can focus on delivering exactly what your customers want, when they want it, and at a price and cost that allows you to make a healthy profit. Tips for Collecting, Organizing, and Displaying Customer Data There is no magic formula for targeting and satisfying customers. In a competitive marketplace, companies are constantly looking for ways to identify and satisfy discrete groups of customers in ways that are difficult to copy. Finding such a strategy is a mixture of art and luck, often obvious only in hindsight. Tip One: Identify Customer Needs Asking Potential Customers Observing Buyer Behavior Observing Usage Patterns Tip Two: Match Customer Needs to Observable Attributes Tip Three: How Price, Location, and Messaging Affect Revenues per Segment Tip Four: Identify the Most Profitable Customers (in the short run) Tip Five: Identify the Most Profitable Customers (in the long run) Customer Lifetime Value Evangelizing Customers Mapping Competitors and Substitutes []{#_Toc9463692 .anchor}[9. Pricing Strategies & The Seasons of Entrepreneurship]{.underline} Season One: Startup In startup season, just remaining in business is Priority One. What does that mean? It means focusing on every single customer and every single unit sold. It's simple: You need revenue and you need it now---you've got fixed-period costs (FPC) like rent and payroll to cover. And in order to cover those costs effectively, you've got to get the price right. Ask yourself, \"Am I attracting an inferior group of customers who are trained to ask for discounts?\" And, \"How will discounts like these affect contribution to my fixed-period costs and my progress toward breakeven?\" Having to say \"no\" to any sale this early is---obviously---tough. But it's necessary. And think about this, too: How's the temptation to discount a symptom of a larger problem? Is the real problem that you haven't found customers who are willing to pay for the value you provide? If so, that needs to be addressed now, before you go any farther. {width=\"6.5in\" height=\"1.94375in\"} Season Two: Shifting Focus to the Segments That Make a Market Now your pricing strategy must shift its focus from individual units and customers to segments: groups of customers who share common characteristics. Pricing is no longer a matter of your judgment on a case-by-case basis---you need more standardized policies that others can execute. Decision time: When you've divided customers into segments, which segment should you commit your pricing strategy? The one that will pay the most? The one that will buy the most? Both? Skim or penetrate? During startup, you priced high to reach breakeven quickly (or, in a less likely and more risky scenario, you priced low to attract lots of early customers to cover high fixed-period costs). But now it's time to decide what your pricing strategy will look like long term. Do you price high to skim the customer segments who place the highest value on your product, or do you price low to penetrate, to capture as much of the market as possible? Let's stick with the water example to illustrate. {width=\"3.597014435695538in\" height=\"2.079907042869641in\"} [Pricing High (Skimming)]{.underline} By pricing high, you'd capture most of the value in serving a single glass of water to the dying millionaire, but the price is far above the value (maximum benefit) perceived by the other segments, so you'll only sell one glass. [Pricing Low (Penetrating)]{.underline} By pricing low, you'll need to sell as many units as possible across all the segments. But pricing low means giving the customers in segments A, B, and C a disproportionately large amount of the value added. {width=\"6.5in\" height=\"2.6180555555555554in\"} Why not just charge different segments different prices? Charging different customers different prices is easier if you are the only salesperson, making snap judgments about each customer. It becomes complicated and difficult to execute when you try to codify this judgment to pass along to salesman and other employees. An important tradeoff this season: early payout or long-term profits? Season two is about making strategic decisions, one segment at a time. But reaching these segments---to advertise and educate them about the benefits of your product---often requires expensive investments in marketing and direct-sales forces, which in turn means charging higher prices to fund these efforts. But, at the same time, you want to keep prices low to encourage more early trial. But, without massive volume, pricing low might not give you the cash you need to encourage early trial to begin with. But pricing low and spending a great deal on marketing means risking large amounts of money to fund losses on a product that may never sell enough units to reach breakeven or payout. Likewise, pricing high and not investing in sales and marketing may lead to failure because uneducated customers are unwilling to pay a high price for unknown benefits [The bottom line? As you segment and price, be sure to account for the time and money it'll take to reach those segments.]{.underline} {width=\"6.5in\" height=\"1.9972222222222222in\"} So, price aside, how should you go about segmenting? You could approach segmenting in two different ways: 1) by focusing your portfolio of products and services and how they satisfy customers in various ways, or 2) by targeting the customer buying experience [Segmenting by Products and Services]{.underline} Customer needs usually fall into the following categories. Ask yourself how your product or services stacks up in each: Performance. How well does your product or service deliver on particular promises in ways that can be measured? Image. How does it change the way customers feel about themselves? Risk. Does the buyer face any risk by purchasing your product? If so, how can this be lowered or eliminated? Simplicity. Is your product easy to understand? Convenience and availability. Is it easy to find and buy? [The Customer Buying Experience]{.underline} Another way to segment is through the way a customer buys and uses the product and service. For example, your customer's experience with your product is likely to include the following steps: Research, costing, pricing, and planning a purchase Purchasing/ordering Delivery Use Billing Post-sale services No matter how well you segment your customers, soon competitors will begin to court those at the margins, those who don't quite \"fit.\" The next section describes how to adapt your products and strategies when---and hopefully before---competitors come knocking. Season Three: Maturity and Beyond It's no longer about the unit-by-unit, customer-by-customer focus of startup. And it's no longer just about segmenting. You're now at a precarious juncture when it comes to pricing. With competitors and substitutes in the mix, your products or services will begin to feel the magnetic tug toward commoditization---despite how good and unique you think your products portfolio is. You could begin discounting to regain or maintain customers who are beginning to look elsewhere. But you faced a similar dilemma about discounting during startup, didn't you? It's time to take action. And that means revisiting your pricing and segmenting strategies. The risk of marginal pricing There are at least three ways to resist commoditization and having to price low, almost all of which require re-segmenting customers and products and ranking them based on profitability. [Rank customers based on profitability]{.underline} You can calculate the profitability of each customer, or even each order, if you look for situations where you are delivering a high benefit for a low price. Either raise prices on these already high-profit customers or target more of them. And most importantly, \"fire\" the low profitability customers to make way for more profitable customers. This way you won't have to add capacity. Refocus your sales on these more desirable customers: get close to them, build and renew trust, provide them with more and more complex and important offerings. [Rank products and orders based on profitability]{.underline} You can also look more closely at the buying process. Which of your products is providing the most customer value, and where in its purchase cycle is the value the highest? Once identified, improve upon those best products and perfect the stages of the buying process that carry the most value. Bring up to speed the stages that bring the lowest value. And always try to move to deliver more for less Remember: Pricing is not a matter of deciding what amount you want to demand for a product or service, but a matter of creating and sharing value with customers. You want to constantly look for ways to create more value, not quibble over negotiating for a smaller and smaller share of a shrinking value pie. [Rank channels based on profitability]{.underline} Which channels are bringing the most profit and growth? Rank your most profitable with your least---like you did with customer segments---and focus on expanding the most profitable ones. Watch out: If increasing sales are coming from a low-margin channel like Walmart, soon average profits as a percentage of revenues will start to decline {width=\"6.5in\" height=\"2.066666666666667in\"} Summary Your pricing strategy changes throughout the entrepreneurial seasons. In the startup season, pricing is a matter of talking customer by customer and measuring unit by unit the contribution that is made toward fixed-period costs, all in a frantic effort to reach breakeven. If you reach breakeven, the role of pricing changes. Now you have gathered enough data on different customer segments to decide which segments to pursue and in what order. Your goals shift from mere survival to accelerating payout and maximizing profits (which often are in conflict) and you now group individual customers into segments, so you can develop standardized processes and routines to serve them more efficiently. These processes and routines---built segment by segment through trial and error---will become the source of your competitive advantage: your differentiation. In the final season, you will face the entropy of success: Complacency. Too much complexity. Growing overhead. Once again it is time to refocus customer by customer, product by product, experience by experience to look for areas to add a great deal of value, for as little cost as possible. []{#_Toc9463693 .anchor}[The Art of Pricing Pt. 1]{.underline} What is a Price? A price is really just a proxy, a number used to state one person's subjective value of an object or service, stated in a currency, like dollars and cents. Most entrepreneurs think of price in one of three ways: Cost-plus based pricing takes the cost in time and materials to make and deliver a product and then adds a cushion of profit. The profit added may be a fixed amount or it may vary as a percentage of cost. Cost-plus pricing has the benefit of being relatively simple: It's fairly easy to calculate the cost of a product and add a margin of profit. The drawback to cost-plus pricing is that it doesn't consider the value added for customers, meaning you could be pricing far lower than necessary, and leaving substantial profits on the table. Value-based pricing focuses on the benefit perceived by customer. The advantage to value-based pricing is that it attempts to capture some or most of the value you create. The drawback is that it requires you to \"put yourself in a customer's shoes\" to discover how much value a customer places on your product or service. Since this is a subjective and ever-changing number, it is difficult to estimate for even one customer, much less a heterogeneous collection of customers. Value-based pricing focuses on the benefit perceived by customer. The advantage to value-based pricing is that it attempts to capture some or most of the value you create. The drawback is that it requires you to \"put yourself in a customer's shoes\" to discover how much value a customer places on your product or service. Since this is a subjective and ever-changing number, it is difficult to estimate for even one customer, much less a heterogeneous collection of customers. Pricing in the Real World: Sharing the Value You Create with Customers So which of the three approaches to pricing is best? Actually, none of them in isolation, all of them in concert. Each approach---cost-plus pricing, value-based pricing, and competition-based pricing---has its merits, but each is only a static way to think about pricing. But pricing isn't a static concept. It's a dynamic conversation between entrepreneurs and consumers, a way of dividing the value created by trading, set amidst the competitive landscape of companies trying to steal each other's most marginal customers. Three important observations about prices: 1. Setting a price determines how a company and its customer share the value created in a transaction. 2. Advertising and education can increase the overall value of a transaction, allowing you to raise the price per unit. 3. Competitive pressures can force you to lower prices, even to a point that forces you into bankruptcy. What Is the \"Right\" Price? So price per unit can vary all the way between variable cost per unit (at least in the short run) and the maximum benefit offered to the customer, if the customer is fully aware of the benefit and has no other alternatives (substitutes). So where should you price in this continuum? Apart from any type of legal constraints or consideration of competitors' pricing, the decision largely depends on: [The type of product or service you are offering]{.underline} a. Impulse Needs (Impulse items are products or services a customer buys largely because \"they are there\" when the mood strikes. Think of a candy bar or a child's toy or a magazine sold at the checkout aisle of the supermarket).\\ b. Utilitarian or Functional Needs (These typically involve a need where the value can be rationally computed by the customer. Think of consumers calculating the benefit of buying a lawnmower and mowing the yard themselves versus paying a landscaping service). {width=\"6.5in\" height=\"3.1145833333333335in\"}c. Image or Complex Needs (These usually say something about the user's identity (for consumer goods) or involve solving complex problems for business customers). [2. Whether your strategy is to \"skim\" or \"penetrate\" a market]{.underline} Your financial and pricing strategy can often be simplified as a decision to skim and price as high as possible, or to penetrate and price low to capture a large share of a market quickly. Skimming means pricing high to skim the highest need customers, adding successive segments of increasingly lower-need customers to build volume. Penetrating means pricing low to attract as many customers as quickly as possible, so you can spread large fixed-period costs over as many units as possible. {width=\"6.5in\" height=\"1.68125in\"} Summary Many take prices for granted, seeing them simply as the amount of money you pay or receive for a product or service. But the savvy entrepreneur sees prices, and the art of pricing, as a far more complex dance, the creation and sharing of value between company and customer, performed in the presence of competitors who are trying to steal customers. One of the miracles of the free market is that, in the absence of fraud or coercion, no sale ever takes place between a buyer and seller that doesn't add value for both. Price is simply the result of an agreement of how the rewards will be shared between the parties. No matter what type of product and service you choose to make and deliver, or whether you plan to skim or penetrate a market, pricing will remain an art---subject to trial and error, practice and mastery---more than a science of market studies and calculation. Practicing this art, and continuing to look for new ways to add value to customers, while avoiding the ruinous price wars that come from competing on price alone, almost certainly may add to your profits, and just may save your business. []{#_Toc9463694 .anchor}[The Art of Pricing Pt. 2]{.underline} {width=\"6.5in\" height=\"2.6902777777777778in\"} Start with Supply The danger of this \"build it and they will come\" approach is that it often encourages people to build businesses that never attract customers. Time and again we find entrepreneurs who make large sunk investments, certain that customers will want their product, only to find that a market never existed. Starting with the Customer How you have chosen your customer, your primary sunk investment, and the \"units\" you produce and deliver, will be the difference between success and failure. Unit Economics is a framework to help you make the very best choices possible. An entrepreneur once defined profit as \"over-recovered\" fixed cost. In Unit Economics, you learn to correctly define the sunk investments and fixed costs your venture will require. Then you will see if you are likely to attract enough customers who will buy enough \"units\" at a high enough price to make the investment worthwhile. And you will learn to do all of this before you make the sunk investment. Bridging the Gap Between Demand and Supply An entrepreneur matches a set of needs with the specifications for a product that satisfies that need. The glue that holds these two \"units\" together is the benefit you offer to the customer when using your product---a product that must be better, faster, or cheaper than any other way of satisfying that need. The combination of the \"unit of desire\" inside the customer, the \"unit of production\" given to the shop foreman, and the benefit the customer gets from using the product, successfully bridges the gap and forms the foundation of your business. This is the framework of unit economics. Demand: Customers, Prices, and Volumes You always start with a customer need and what the customer is willing to pay to satisfy it. But this answer is too simple. You cannot survey every customer, ask them what they want, and customize a solution. The cost of discovery and customization is too great. You need to find a group of customers with relatively homogeneous needs. [How do you determine a price?]{.underline} Quantify the maximum value your customer places on your product . This is the highest possible price you could charge (because no one would buy it after that). Measure your costs per unit. (Costs can vary depending on volume, but we'll get to that later. For now, choose a volume and measure cost per unit at that volume). The difference between the max value and the cost per unit is the \"shared value,\" because it's the total value of the product that must get divided up between you and the customer. Decide how much of the shared value you want to keep to yourself and how much you will give to the customer. Your price will be based on how much value you want to keep and concede. All of this works beautifully, until one little problem arises: a competing product or substitute of the same value starts selling for less. With no apparent difference in the value received by the customer, no customer will pay more for your product. So your new ceiling price is the price of the substitute. Decide again how much shared value you want to offer the customer and how much you want to keep, and you've determined your new price. {width=\"5.658536745406824in\" height=\"3.5287248468941383in\"} Value But how does a customer decide on the value of a product? Value is judged in the mind of an individual. The maximum price a customer will pay is set inside the mind of each consumer as they make subjective and sometimes irrational tradeoffs between the money they have, the intensity of the desires they wish to satisfy, {width=\"6.5in\" height=\"3.2729166666666667in\"} The Mistake of Using Costs to Set Prices Many people use a \"cost-plus\" approach to pricing because it is easier to calculate the costs of production than to crawl inside the heads of your customers to measure their whims. That is why this note started with you stumbling onto an empty pipeline, and why so many people take a \"build it and hope they will come\" approach. But setting prices based on costs is a mistake. If costs lead you to price below what your customers are willing to pay, you may give away too much value to the customer. If costs lead you to price above what your customers are willing to pay, you will not sell a single unit, and all of your costs will truly be \"sunk.\" Basing prices on costs can cause you to miss a lucrative opportunity. What is a Primary Sunk Investment? A primary sunk investment is: \u2022 The most important investment a company makes to satisfy its chosen set of customers. \u2022 Either the largest investment the company makes or the asset that would be the most expensive to duplicate. \u2022 A process or asset that allows a company to do the most important tasks again and again in the most efficient way possible to deliver exactly what the customer will pay for. \u2022 The single most important investment to: (1) invent a new product or create a new product; (2) attract customers; (3) manufacture a product; or (4) deliver a product. 15 It typically serves every customer in the same way. {width=\"6.5in\" height=\"4.685416666666667in\"} Summary Unit economics is about making sunk investments---primary sunk investments---where you are confident you can \"over-recover\" the investment to make a profit. When you start your business, it is critical to have defined your primary sunk investment, and the \"units\" its standardized process is designed to deliver. You must understand that the key attributes of these \"units of production\" are critical for satisfying the \"units of desire\" in your subset of customers, how many of these customers are likely to buy and what price they will pay. You then can calculate the variable and fixed period costs required to attract, make, and deliver these units, and how long it will take to recover your primary sunk investment and other start-up costs. All of business---from water pipelines to theme parks---is a matter of making and recovering sunk investments in a standardized set of processes. If you are clear about the \"units\" you are selling, and the primary sunk investment you have made, the chances are much higher that you will \"over recover\" your fixed and sunk costs and survive. []{#_Toc9463695 .anchor}The Sales Funnel A sales funnel can help: 1. Predict how sales calls today will impact revenue later. 2. Calculate the average cost of making each sale and acquiring each customer. 3. Gauge the quality of prospects you attract, quantify the cost of each step of the sales process and note the number of potential customers who drop out at every step, so it becomes clear where you need to focus your efforts to improve your sales process. Sales Funnel's vs. Production Lines Assembly lines are about doing the right thing. Sales funnels are about asking the right questions, offering the right choices, watching what customers do, and praying they decide to buy in the end. 1 Just How Difficult is it to Predict Customer Behavior? The actions of human beings are hard to predict and influence, but if you break down a sales process into discrete steps, pay close attention to why some prospects are more likely to close than others, and measure how many prospects defect at each step, you can begin to make the sales process more predictable. The Value of a Quick \"No\" The only thing better than a quick \"yes\" in sales is a quick \"no.\" A quick \"no\" from a disinterested prospect frees you up to search for a customer who truly needs what you are offering. The worst type of prospect is one that takes up an inordinate amount of your time and, only after a great deal of time, attention, and money has been spent, decides not to buy. {width=\"4.72619094488189in\" height=\"4.199543963254593in\"} Building a Sales Funnel The Major Questions for Sales Funnel Design: The design of your sales process will depend on whether your customers are: (1) easy or hard to find, (2) eager or reluctant to buy, and (3) worth a lot or a little to close. Customers who are easy to find, eager to buy, and valuable to close are an entrepreneur's dream. Customers who are difficult to find, hard to convince, and of little value to close are an entrepreneur's nightmare. It is with the \"in-between\" customers that the right sales process can make the difference between success and failure. The Major Decisions in Sales Funnel Design Do you want to grow quickly or slowly? Will your campaign be broad or targeted? Will you have an intense sales effort to convince prospects to buy, or a more restrained approach? Will you go to your customer, or have them come to you? Will you take all comers, or be selective about the customers you choose? What Is the Difference between a Lead, a Prospect, and a Qualified Prospect? Unfortunately, we cannot tell from outward appearance when a customer moves from being a lead---someone who is mildly curious---to being a prospect who is more likely to close. We can ask our customers questions, but they do not always answer truthfully and often change their minds. Staging Investments We need to test as many sales funnel alternatives as possible before committing to large upfront and fixed-period costs. Your initial estimates will likely be wrong. That is why it is important to stage, test, and carefully monitor the yield and costs at each step of the process. The longer your sales cycle and the faster you intend to grow, the more important it is to collect data early in the process so that you can adapt quickly Sizing the Funnel Once you've estimated how your sales cycle, the average costs per sale, and the capacity of the funnel varies for different sales funnel arrangements, you can compare your estimates of how quickly sales will increase to the overall size of the market. You'll want to size the sales funnel so that you attract customers quickly enough to discourage competitors from entering your niche, but recover all of your costs and make a healthy profit before you run out of prospects. Some Tips on the Sales Process It is generally much cheaper to sort and qualify customers who are interested in buying than to try to interest and persuade customers (changing minds is expensive). Each additional step in a sales funnel adds an exponential amount of complexity and cost. Communications and handoffs from one step in the process to another are expensive and difficult to execute. Targeted approaches tend to work better than broad approaches. Convincing customers to come to you is usually far more effective than having to go to them. Summary Designing and building a sales funnel is much more difficult than designing an assembly line. Using machines to cut and shape widgets is much easier than attracting, informing, sorting, and closing finicky potential customers. The difficulty involved makes it even more important to design a sales funnel that fits with the type of customer we want to attract and the benefits we offer. Each time we spend money to attract, sort, or convince customers, we must measure the number and quality of the prospects that move to the next step. That way, over time, we will learn to predict how to turn customers' needs into revenue as quickly as possible, at the lowest possible cost per sale, and to recover the costs of our sales funnel long before we run out of potential customers.

A Note Far too many mid-level managers and corporate executives spend far too much time with whitecollar marketers like themselves and far too little time on the salesroom floor with salespeople, carefully tracking leads as they move through the sales process to become customers and then repeat customers. The best companies pay special attention to improving their sales funnels, but even in these companies, the ability to build (or rebuild) a sales funnel from scratch is missing, perhaps because the existing funnel is taken for granted. That may be because sales funnels are built by founders initially, not in a deterministic way, but through careful trial and error, as the founding entrepreneur becomes too busy and has to begin standardizing and delegating tasks. At each step of building the sales funnel, an entrepreneur has to sell through trial and error by keenly observing the path that the most valuable customers take and by looking to improve the volume of sales and the quality of customers, while simultaneously lowering the average cost per sale. This process of constructing an increasingly effective and efficient sales funnel requires careful experimentation, a keen eye, intuitive leaps, and a fair helping of luck to identify the processes, skills, and judgment needed to make a particular sales funnel more effective. Despite the difficulty, building an efficient and effective sales funnel is well worth the effort. It is often the key []{#_Toc9463697 .anchor}A Sales Funnel or Word of Mouth (WOM)? A. To design and create a Sales Funnel---a series of steps to attract, qualify, educate, and close customers. B. To work hard to delight your first few customers, so that these early converts begin a Word of Mouth (WOM) movement that results in exploding revenues. A sales funnel sounds like a lot of work, but more scientific and predictable. A word of mouth approach sounds like more fun and potentially much more lucrative, but harder to predict. So which is better for your business? The short answer: It depends. {width=\"3.592600612423447in\" height=\"1.8690474628171478in\"} {width=\"4.013888888888889in\" height=\"2.6805555555555554in\"} The Benefits and Drawbacks of Sales Funnels and Word of Mouth Sales funnels ---when well built and implemented---provide a systematic approach to increasing revenues. Under the right conditions, every step of the process can be tested to see which messages and techniques increase close rates, add to customer satisfaction, or decrease costs. The drawbacks? They're expensive to design and operate and, when done poorly, may make customers feel more like widgets on a factory assembly line than highly valued individuals. And the only way to increase sales is to pump more and better leads into the start of the funnel. Sales funnels tend to work better for higher-priced functional products or simple image-based ones, where benefits can be explained and reluctant customers discarded at each step along the way. Word of Mouth (WOM) has the advantage of rapid, often exponential sales growth, at a very low cost. Plus, done properly, customers may begin to develop a deep sense of belonging, making it hard for competitors to lure them away. Word of mouth is easy to recognize and fun to talk about, but unfortunately it's very hard to execute deliberately. In practice, it's difficult to ignite the right spark and keep enthusiasm at consistently high levels from one generation of customers to the next, because the technique depends largely on the emotions of crowds and societal trends. Word of mouth sales also tend to work better for more complex \"image\" or \"identity\" products and services, or for faddish impulse items than for more mundane, functional products. How Do You Create and Execute a Successful Word of Mouth Campaign? Start with a product that involves image or identity element of image or belonging---they say something about who you are, and they describe deep, important issues that you want to share with your \"tribe.\" Create a message that's memorable and \"sticky\" so it spreads easily. a. It is simple \"Get it there.\" b. It surprises you; it is unexpected Tom's Shoes promises to donate a pair to a child in need. c. Concreteness Your senses are excited. Emotional words lead to something you can feel and touch d. Credibility There are powerful testimonials from people who do not have any conflicts of interest. e. Emotions You are touched deeply, often with a positive feeling like hope or gratitude f. Story There is a simple, powerful, often redemptive, story Delight all your customers---capture, affirm, and arm the evangelical ones g. Connectors know lots of people and enjoy bringing them together in constructive ways h. Mavens are experts. They specialize in collecting and sharing information i. Salespeople are persuaders. They convince people to take risks, to try something j. they wouldn't ordinarily try Keep the conversation going -- make them feel valued part of a new movement and an important part of enlisting others in the cause k. Once a customer engages, ask him or her for advice, and show that you take their ideas seriously and that you put those ideas to work. l. Ask them to test and provide feedback on new products. m. Even ask for suggestions for new products to introduce Provide incentives, but be careful not to try to purchase loyalty. Have strong \"we believe\" statements. Measure the right markers n. Track what percentage of your customers says \"yes\" to the question, \"Would you recommend this product or service to a friend?\" o. Measure how many new customers come from referrals. p. Count the number of new product ideas submitted by customers. The right timing helps---a lot. Great stories and deep emotions are timeless. But context helps immensely too No matter how exactly you plan to execute, keep these basic principles from Seth Godin in mind. a. Transparency. Your customers aren't stupid. If they think for a second that you're being inauthentic about your passion for your product or service (and why should you be, really?), they'll bolt. b. A movement bigger than you. How does your product or service help change the world in a significant way? c. Movements that grow, thrive. WOM is about more that short-term tactics. How is today part of a growing, dynamic tomorrow? d. Exclude outsiders. How well have you chosen your customers and followers so that you don't expend wasted effort elsewhere? So Which Is Better---a Sales Funnel or a Word of Mouth Campaign? So which is it? The truth is---you need them both. {width=\"6.5in\" height=\"2.071527777777778in\"} WOM campaigns sound exciting, but they're usually too unreliable and unpredictable of a technique on which to bet your future. That means that once you find the right customer niche, you need a well-designed sales funnel: a repeatable, scalable process that gives you a higher probability of surviving startup and the early years of the launch phase. But if you have the right products, and sense the spark of delighted customers who want to tell their friends, it'd be foolish not to try to fan these sparks into a WOM wildfire that could turn your best customers not only into a free sales force, but into a tribe that no competitor could lead astray. +-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+ | | Sales Funnel | Word of Mouth | +=======================+=======================+=======================+ | Definition | The sales funnel | - viral marketing | | | breaks the sales | | | | process into the | - product or brand | | | discrete steps | evangelists---spr | | | required to attract, | ead | | | educate, qualify, and | the word to new | | | close customers | customers | | | | | | | | - Every step of the | | | | sales funnel | | | | still occurs but | | | | now customers are | | | | performing these | | | | tasks (usually) | | | | for free, as they | | | | spread the word | | | | to friends and | | | | family and | | | | convince them to | | | | buy | +-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+ | Benefits | - When well-built | - rapid, often | | | and | exponential sales | | | implemented---pro | growth, at a very | | | vide | low cost | | | a systematic | | | | approach to | - done properly, | | | increasing | customers may | | | Revenues | begin to develop | | | | a deep sense of | | | - every step of the | belonging, making | | | process can be | it hard for | | | tested to see | competitors to | | | which messages | lure them away | | | and techniques | | | | increase close | - tend to work | | | rates, add to | better for more | | | customer | complex \"image\" | | | satisfaction, or | or \"identity\" | | | decrease costs | products and | | | | services, or for | | | - work better for | faddish impulse | | | higher-priced | items than for | | | functional | more mundane, | | | products or | functional | | | simple | products | | | image-based ones | | +-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+ | Drawbacks | - expensive to | - very hard to | | | design and | execute | | | operate | deliberately | | | | | | | - when done poorly, | - difficult to | | | may make | ignite the right | | | customers feel | spark and keep | | | more like widgets | enthusiasm at | | | on a factory | consistently high | | | assembly line | levels from one | | | than highly | generation of | | | valued | customers to the | | | individuals | next, because the | | | | technique depends | | | | largely on the | | | | emotions of | | | | crowds and | | | | societal trends | | | | | | | | - usually too | | | | unreliable and | | | | unpredictable of | | | | a | | | | | | | | - technique on | | | | which to bet your | | | | future | +-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+ | Sales process | \"Attract-Educate-Qual | \"Attract-Educate-Qual | | | ify-Close,\" | ify- | | | | | | | | Close-Connect-Affirm- | | | | Arm\" | +-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+ To spark powerful WOM: An amazing and useful product or service Fierce passion for that product or service and for letting those who can benefit from it know about it.

Answering a Question with a Question is an ongoing process. Don't just ask a question for the sake of asking a question; use the information you gather from your prospect's answers to inform your next questions. 2. Never answer an unasked question. Sometimes what sounds like a question is actually just a statement. Don't make assumptions. Don't answer what you think your prospect is asking---they could be confused or thinking aloud. Ask for clarification. For example, \"The price is too high\" is not a question. You could respond with, \"Does that mean that...?\" in order to get the prospect to nail down their precise problem. 3. If a prospect asks the same question twice, answer it. If you continue asking questions, you'll set the wrong tone for the meeting. The prospect will think you're being coy or playing games.

Dealing with Bottlenecks: Identify the bottleneck Exploit the bottleneck Subordinate everything else to the above decision Elevate the bottleneck Go Back to the first step, and repeat {width=\"4.608695319335083in\" height=\"6.193184601924759in\"} The Goal Pt. 1 The Goal Pt. 2 What is the goal? To Increase throughput while simultaneously decreasing inventory and operating expenses. Throughput: the rate at which the system generates money through sales (the money coming in) Inventory: all the money invested in things it intends to sell (money in the system) Operating Expenses: the money spent to turn inventory into throughput (money you pay to make throughput happen) Five Focusing Steps for Continuous Improvement : Find the bottleneck. Get more from the bottleneck's current resources. Redirect existing resources towards the bottleneck, don't produce more than it can or you'll build up inventory. Increase resources for the bottleneck ONLY once you've squeezed the most you can out of it. Find the new constraint and return to step 1, consider increasing resources to other areas to match the bottleneck's improvement. You could think you're running an efficient system, but your thinking might be wrong. If you didn't increase sales, throughput, or decrease costs, you didn't increase productivity . If you don't know what the real goal is, which you could very well be wrong about, then you can't figure out what to do to reach the goal. And the goal of any business is to make money . If you keep everyone and everything working at full capacity, you'll naturally build up inventory by creating excess work. A plant where everyone is working all the time is very inefficient. You can't have a \"balanced plant\" without doing excess work. Because of dependent events and statistical fluctuations , you'll naturally run into bottlenecks in the system, kind of like the fattest kid on a hike slowing everyone down. The whole system only moves as fast as the bottleneck , so it makes sense to focus on increasing the bottleneck's capacity and tying the rest of the system's rate to the rate of the bottleneck. In the analogy, put the fat kid at the front of the line, and make his backpack as light as possible so he can walk faster. Since output can only deviate up to the maximum level determined by its dependent events , but it can deviate down much lower, with successive dependent events you'll get further and further negative fluctuations. A kid can come to a halt, but he can only catch up as much as the kid in front of him, he can never catch up past the point the previous kid has already walked. Bottleneck: \"A bottleneck is any resource whose capacity is equal to or less than the demand placed upon it. And a non-bottleneck is any resource whose capacity is greater than the demand placed on it.\" [139] An easy way to find a bottleneck is to look and see what has a big pile of work in front of it [144] To optimize the system, make the flow through the bottleneck equal to the demand from the market . Or, a tiny bit less than the demand from the market. [139] In most cases you'll have capacity that is hidden from you because some of your thinking is incorrect . The first thing you should always do is see exactly how the bottlenecks are currently operating, and if you can change how they're used to increase their capacity (before simply hiring or buying more tools). [152] If you lose even one hour on the bottleneck, you have lost it forever. You can't get it back somewhere else in the system . Your throughput for the entire system will be lower by whatever amount the bottleneck produces in that time. [153] Lost time on the bottleneck is lost throughput which means you've lost the total output of the whole system . If your whole plant earns \\$1,000 an hour, then an hour lost on the bottleneck is \\$1,000 lost . Make sure it's time isn't wasted by: [157 / 159] Sitting idle and not getting used during some break For it to be spending time on output that's already defective Making it work on something you don't need You can increase the capacity of the bottleneck by: [159] Only making it work on what will increase throughput today Taking some of the load off the bottleneck and giving it to non-bottlenecks When you make a non-bottleneck do more work than the bottleneck, you create excess inventory and thus lose money. [210] What you have to do is figure out how to release materials at the start of the process exactly according to the capacity of the bottleneck . [216] If you reduce your batch size, you increase throughput by reducing inventory held and reducing the amount of cash tied up at any one time. It also lets you move faster, since the gaps will be smaller since the time to process a batch will be lowered as well, and your total lead time on any project condenses. [232] Three simple questions: What to change, what to change to, and how to cause the change. [337] Scheduling & Sequencing Pt. 1 Gantt Chart Basics A Gantt chart is a horizontal bar graph used to visualize the sequence and timing of tasks in a project or process.1 Gantt charts are a useful planning instrument before a project starts and can be used during a project to measure progress and make it easier for team members to communicate. {width=\"6.816735564304462in\" height=\"2.447761373578303in\"} Creating a Gantt chart is like creating a puzzle. How you solve it will depend on your goals and constraints. For example, you may need to finish a project as fast as possible. Or you might want to finish a project with limited resources before a deadline. Developing a Gantt chart helps you visualize and confront scheduling challenges associated with your project or process. As you work to define the tasks and sequence them, you may need to gather information or assistance from your project team or customer. Once a project is underway, your Gantt chart can serve as a reminder of the tasks that need to be completed each day (or hour or minute) and as a checkpoint to make sure each task is being completed on time. []{#_Toc9463701 .anchor}Processes 101 Processes Processes are important for entrepreneurs because dividing a more complex task into smaller steps enables the creation of value to be standardized---which allows an individual worker to specialize and learn to do an individual task better, cheaper, and faster over time. With each task in your process specialized, you can hire lower cost labor or even purchase a machine to automate the task. Once you have established the specifications demanded by customers to satisfy their needs and desires and have decided what range of customer need you will serve (which determines how wide a variability your process will serve), you can begin to experiment with how finely to divide tasks and how to order them. Creating a Process 1. Define the Customer Need 2. Designing: Choose which part of the process you will own 3. Designing: Chart the steps you will control 4. Execute your process in the real world 5. Continually improve Process Mapping Being able to describe, order, chart, and measure individual tasks and overall processes is a critical skill for entrepreneurs. That means learning, practicing with, and becoming fluent in the symbols and conventions of Process Flow Diagrams (or Process Maps), which allow you to describe and measure a process on paper---and share it with managers and others---before you try it for real. Here's a brief vocabulary lesson in the language of Process Flow Diagrams: A rectangle represents a single Task in the process. A task is completed at a workstation where energy or labor is used to transform a material or deliver a service. Usually there is a worker in charge of doing the work, sometimes with the aid of some equipment. Sometimes tasks are automated and do not require a worker. {width=\"1.9583333333333333in\" height=\"1.1527777777777777in\"} {width=\"5.694444444444445in\" height=\"1.1111111111111112in\"} {width=\"6.069444444444445in\" height=\"1.2083333333333333in\"} {width=\"6.5in\" height=\"1.8097222222222222in\"} 1. Raw Materials are inputs of material into the process. 2. Work in Process (WIP) means units of production that have been partially, but not completely, transformed from Raw Materials into Finished Goods and are temporarily stored in a queue awaiting the next step in the process. 3. Finished Goods (FGI) are final products that have been completely transformed by 8 the process and are ready for delivery to the customer. 3 Types of Processes Serial Process Parallel Process Batch Process {width=\"6.5in\" height=\"2.4680555555555554in\"} A Parallel Process is when the exact same task is done simultaneously by two or more workstations at the same time, to divide the flow into multiple streams. Parallel workstations make sense when it's not cheaper to use a larger machine. {width=\"5.0in\" height=\"3.1191240157480316in\"} A Batch Process means that a group of products are all acted on by a workstation at once, rather than one at a time. Process Metrics The most important measures of the performance of your operation are: \u2022 Reliability. How effective are you at making units that meet specification? \u2022 Flexibility. How much variability can your process handle? \u2022 Capacity. How many units can you produce in a given time period? \u2022 Lead-time. How long does it take for a customer's order to be filled? \u2022 Overall investment. How much money, including equipment, inventory, etc., is tied up in the line? [Some Definitions]{.underline} Capacity How many units (on average) could a given workstation transform in a period of time? Capacity is important because the overall process capacity will be constrained by the workstation with the lowest capacity. Output How many actual units did a given workstation actually transform in a period of time, given that the process didn't work exactly as expected? Actual output is important because it shows how well the workstation is performing in reality versus what it theoretically could produce. Process Time How long does it take to transform inputs into one unit of output at a given workstation? The process time of a task is important because the sum of all process times from start to finish, will determine how long a customer must wait before their product is delivered. Cycle Time How frequently are units completed at a particular process stage? For a workstation with two workers performing tasks in parallel, the cycle time will be 50 percent of what it would be with only one worker performing the task. In general, the equation for calculating cycle time for a workstation is: (Task process time per unit) / (# of Tasks in Parallel at Workstation) Cycle time is important for an entrepreneur to understand, because cycle time tells you for a given period of time how many units are being produced at this workstation. The cycle time for the process as a whole is the same as the cycle time of the individual component process (or processes) with the greatest cycle time -- also known as the \"bottleneck\" process. {width=\"6.5in\" height=\"3.10625in\"} Idle Time A workstation which does not have any work-in-process inventory available to be transformed is experiencing idle time. Idle time represents unused capacity at the workstation. Too much idle time at a workstation is a waste of resources. Depending on the needs of the overall process, you might seek to increase the availability of work-in-process inventory at the workstation so there is less idle time, or you may reassign the idle worker to perform another task. So when a workstation is experiencing idle time, it is operating at less than 100 percent capacity (this isn't necessarily a bad thing). A useful way to measure the productivity of a workstation is capacity utilization. To calculate the capacity utilization for a workstation for a given time period, simply divide the actual production output by the expected capacity. For example, if a workstation is capable of transforming 50 units per hour, but is only able to produce 30 units per hour due to idle time, then the capacity utilization for the workstation is: Capability Utilization = (Actual Output)/(Expected Capacity) = (30 units)/(50 units) = 0.60 = 60% Wait Time The amount of time that the unit being transformed has to wait in queue prior to entering the next workstation is referred to as wait time. Wait time is important to calculate because a unit waiting is a unit that is not being converted into money from sales. Lead-Time Lead-time is an important measure of your process. The simplest definition is that lead-time is the total elapsed time from when a request is made to when the request is filled. Process Balance A process is balanced when the capacities of each process stage are closely matched, resulting in a minimum of idle time for the workstations and a minimum amount of wait time for WIP inventory. However, once your line is up and running, balancing the capacities of each process stage is not a critical goal. Once your real-world line is running, you should focus on finding and eliminating bottlenecks. Bottlenecks: An Important Limiting Factor {width=\"6.5in\" height=\"1.3444444444444446in\"} Summary It's important as an entrepreneur to establish a clear goal for your operations to meet the specific requirements of a customer or defined group of customers. When you focus on a specific need and learn to say \"no\" to other distractions, you are better able to align all your processes to meet your customer's need better than your competitors. Mapping and measuring your process helps you to identify, specialize, delegate, and optimize each step. First, you must be able to design and implement a process that adds value for customers. This means giving customers something they want, reliably, and for a cost they will accept. The faster the rate (capacity) and quicker the speed (lead-time) that you can get the product into your customer's hands, the greater advantage you will have. Unlike a paper process map, a real-world process is dynamic and sometimes difficult to handle. The better you understand the components of your process, the more able you will be to adjust as real-world forces nibble at your assumptions. A process with flexibility will allow you over time to reconfigure the process and product to meet the ever-changing landscape of market forces. Operations is a never-ending quest to deliver the right product, at the right time, with the lowest cost per unit. 3 Business Model Archetypes Archetypes are only models and each has a different trade off between risk and reward. The attractiveness of any particular business depends not only on its model, but how well management executes, the reactions of the competition, and the general business context. Artisan Deliver highly customized products to customers who will pay for exactly what they want [Examples:]{.underline} portrait artist, tailor of handmade suits, tutor Job Shop S ome customers need a limited number of standardized products, too many units to be made by hand, but not enough units from any one customer to justify investments in expensive machinery. Job shops spread the costs of machinery over a larger number of units by combining customer orders and using production lines that can be reconfigured to produce small batches of different products. [Examples:]{.underline} small bakery producing a variety of items, machine shop producing batches of different electrical components, software programming company that customizes input screens while reusing a core set of code Mass Production Mass production facilities produce large quantities of standardized products (commodities) for customers who care more about price than customization. Long production runs spread fixed period costs and investments over a large number of units [Examples:]{.underline} a commodity chemical factory, generic drug manufacturer, automobile manufacturer Each archetype and every business model represents different trade-offs between cash, risk and time. The attractiveness of any real business will depend on how well you select and satisfy customers, how well you match demand to the right production processes and how you defend against competitors. Each model has a characteristic pattern of cash flows that are driven by it's unit economics. It is good to compare these models by their [pre-tax operating margin]{.underline}: the percentage of each dollar of revenue that remains after operating expenses have been subtracted. Each of the three archetypal business models has a different relationship between price, unit volume, cost structures, and free cash flows. One way to talk about these patters is in terms of pre-tax operating margin. Pre-tax operating margin is the percentage of each dollar of revenue that remains after operating expenses have been subtracted. To calculate pre-tax operating margin, divide the toal pre-tax cash flow by the total revenue. To estimate it, compare the amount of space taken up by the green bar (pre-tax cash flow), as compared to the total height of the stacked bar (revenue). {width=\"2.8761286089238847in\" height=\"3.9535903324584427in\"} {width=\"3.0930008748906386in\" height=\"4.281165791776028in\"} {width=\"3.1014490376202977in\" height=\"4.351570428696413in\"} {width=\"1.7361111111111112in\" height=\"0.8472222222222222in\"} {width=\"6.5in\" height=\"4.597916666666666in\"} []{#_Toc9463702 .anchor}Making Incremental Improvements A busy entrepreneur must choose between one of four actions as the next focus for improvements in operations: 1. Create a new process. 2. Incrementally improve an existing process. 3. Make a large bet to leapfrog the current operational model. 4. Make serious cost reductions to eliminate costly spare capacity. {width=\"6.5in\" height=\"5.143055555555556in\"} Creating a Culture of Continuous Improvement 1. When your operations are running smoothly, encourage your people to use downtime to look for improvements. Take that time to make minor operational tweaks when the operation is below capacity--- you'll have the time and attention to do so, which won't be true if the plant is pushing 100- percent capacity. 2. Encourage employees to continuously improve, standardize, and delegate tasks. Make sure that all the steps in your process are standardized, documented, and delegated to properly trained people. Take another look at your production process. Are there tasks being done by highly paid employees that have now become routine enough to be performed by lower-cost labor, if only the steps were more simply described? Could automation relieve an employee from a mundane task? 3. Set measurable goals that are tied to incentives, and pay well for exceptional performance. People work for many reasons besides money, but you are foolish to ask them to do things against their own self-interest. Set clear, measurable, objective goals---ambitious but reachable---and pay your people well for exceeding them. You'll be shocked at how many more excellent suggestions you get from workers on the frontline than from newly minted MBAs. 4. Make heroes of your top-performing employees and share their magic. Look for your top-performing employees. What are they doing better than the average employee? Can you make heroes of your top workers? Celebrate them in some way? Ask them to create a manual or video that shows how a task can be improved? Hold a contest to encourage additional innovations? How can you capture the improvements in ways that spread them across the company and encourage more innovation? 5. Keep a close eye on your competitors. What about competitors? Have you heard from your customers or suppliers about process improvements that have been offered by competitors or new entrants? Has there been some sort of technological leap that you've overlooked? Is there an easy way to copy these? 6. Make reducing waste a virtue. Praise those who eliminate waste. Are there ways to use materials more efficiently? Are there extra process steps that can be removed? Is there unnecessary movement of resources or transportation of inventory? Can work-in-process inventories be reduced to lessen inventory costs and improve throughput time? Where in the process do rejects or rework appear? Are quality-control steps placed as early in the process as possible, so that you aren't wasting time and effort on products that will later be rejected because of an early flaw? Can you trace rejects to a systemic flaw in procedures or some sort of variation in the quality of raw materials? 7. Look down the supply chain for gains Can you find suppliers that will deliver materials faster or cheaper? Provide better terms? Are there tasks you can outsource so that you can spend you most precious resources on doing what your customers value most? 8. Look up to your customers for ways to delight them. Ask the sales department to let its salespeople speak directly to those on the shop floor about your customers' needs. Is there something your customer doesn't like doing that you could do for them? {width=\"7.5151520122484685in\" height=\"4.542010061242345in\"} Operational Hiccups {width=\"6.5in\" height=\"3.3756944444444446in\"} Little's Law {width=\"6.5in\" height=\"6.256944444444445in\"} []{#_Toc9463703 .anchor}Operations Midpoint Reflection Pt. 1 []{#_Toc9463704 .anchor}Operations Midpoint Reflection Pt. 2 {width=\"6.5in\" height=\"7.1819444444444445in\"} []{#_Toc9463705 .anchor}Surveying the Battlefield Supply chain distribution network, normally of different firms to get supplies and materials from vendor to customer; e.g., from production to distribution to retailers and to customers Each business in a supply chain also must make frequent decisions about how much inventory to carry to keep goods flowing smoothly Bullwhip effect small changes in demand can rapidly build into sever problems for periods of variable or uncertain demands The longer the supply chain, the less information that is exchanged between firms and the more uncertain demand, the higher the chance of a serious bullwhip effect problem Any link in the supply chain with a bottleneck can affect the entire supply chain network Safety Stock excess inventory apart from demand, to make sure that inventory does not run out\\ Kanban a scheduling system for lean manufacturing and just-in-time manufacturing How to avoid bullwhip effect tracking more closer to the end customer can help better plan for future production levels with less variability and uncertainty (e.g., track monthly sales at the retail level) a. Large retailers or end users can try to keep demand as level as possible by relying on forecasts of future demand to set long term production schedules and contracts. Handling variations in demand by tolerating stockouts or reducing prices to get rid of excess FG inventory. Drawback: puts great pressure on end users to forecast accurately b. Large retailers or end users can either vertically integrate and share information internally between different production stages using a \"Kanban\" approach to send restocking signals or insist that independent firms can share demand information freely. Drawback: powerful end users can use control of the information system to demand concessions from smaller suppliers who might be excluded from the information system if they refuse to lower prices Situation Action When demand exceeds capacity Produce at capacity until demand weakens When demand is unpredictable Information sharing along the supply chain for shorter lead time in production and delivery, and better inventory management When there is competitive disadvantage Information sharing won't be beneficial as somewhere along the supply chain, information may get \"leaked\" and competitors down the supply chain may be able to catch up When demand is predictable Information sharing will be impractical. Instead, utilize all data you have and use historical data, market trends to make forecasts When to maintain high inventory levels: To maintain inventory buffer (safety stock) to avoid running out of FG and missing sales opportunities To take advantage of lower costs by purchasing in bulk To capture rare materials and create a supply bottleneck for competitors Generally, risk is reduced when you collaborate with more than one business at each step in the supply chain (e.g., have multiple sources of RM and distribution). Relying on single source can provide competitive advantage, but could shut down if the only provider also fails. +-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+ | How to optimize supply chain? | | +===================================+===================================+ | Product flow | - Reduce the lead time for | | | products to flow through the | | | supply chain | | | | | | - Minimize the inventory in the | | | system, while ensuring | | | effective flow and supply | | | | | | - Set and maintain quality | | | standards | | | | | | - Reduce costs | | | | | | - When possible, use modular | | | (generic) components that are | | | available from multiple | | | suppliers | | | | | | - Transfer costs and risks to | | | third parties by outsourcing | | | or pushing upstream | +-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+ | Information flow | - Gather and transmit accurate | | | and timely information about | | | orders and delivery status | | | | | | - Share forecast and actual | | | demand data needed to | | | collaboratively synchronize | | | product flow | | | | | | - Gather and share market data | | | that will lead to better | | | sales and profits | | | | | | - Share quality data to enable | | | better quality control | +-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+ | Money flow | - Seek cash or short terms on | | | AR | | | | | | - Seek longer terms on AP | | | | | | - When prudent, extend longer | | | terms on AR in exchange for | | | valuable cooperation: access | | | to market information or | | | preferred delivery schedules | +-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+ +-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+ | Situation | Action | +===================================+===================================+ | When there are multiple vendors | Rely on the market.

It often batches or accumulates demands before issuing an order. There are two forms of order batching: periodic ordering and push ordering. a. Periodic ordering: A company with slow-moving items may prefer to order on a regular cyclical basis because there may not be enough items consumed to warrant resupply if it orders more frequently.\\ \\ One common obstacle for a company that wants to order frequently is the economics of transportation b. Push ordering: a company experiences regular surges in demand. The company has orders \"pushed\" on it from customers periodically because salespeople are regularly measured, sometimes quarterly or annually, which causes end-of-quarter or end-of-year order surges\\ \\ For companies, the ordering pattern from their customers is more erratic than the consumption patterns that their customers experience. The \"hockey stick\" phenomenon is quite prevalent If all customers' order cycles were spread out evenly throughout the week, the bullwhip effect would be minimal Price fluctuation Forward buying results from price fluctuations in the marketplace. This is an arrangement in which items were bought in advance of requirements, usually because of a manufacturer's attractive price offer Rationing and shortage gaming When product demand exceeds supply, a manufacturer often rations its product to customers. The effect of \"gaming\" is that customers' orders give the supplier little information on the product's real demand, a particularly vexing problem for manufacturers in a product's early stages How to Counteract the Bullwhip Effect: information sharing demand information at a downstream site is transmitted upstream in a timely fashion channel alignment coordination of pricing, transportation, inventory planning, and ownership between the upstream and downstream sites in a supply chain operational efficiency activities that improve performance, such as reduced costs and lead time Avoid Multiple Demand Forecast Updates make demand data at a downstream site available to the upstream site electronic data interchange (EDI) to share data upstream site would have access to the demand and inventory information at the downstream site and update the necessary forecasts and resupply for the downstream site vendor-managed inventory (VMI) or a continuous replenishment program (CRP) Another approach is to try to get demand information about the downstream site by bypassing it direct to consumers Break Order Batches smaller batches or more frequent resupply EDI can reduce the cost of the paperwork in generating an order distributors to order assortments of different products. Hence a truckload may contain different products from the same manufacturer instead of a full load of the same product use of third-party logistics companies also helps make small batch replenishments economical customers spread their periodic orders or replenishments evenly over time, they can reduce the negative effect of batching coordinate their resupply with their customers Stabilize prices reduce both the frequency and the level of wholesale price discounting everyday low price (EDLP) or value pricing strategy Activity-based costing (ABC) systems enable companies to recognize the excessive costs of forward buying and diversions explicit accounting of the costs of inventory, storage, special handling, premium transportation, and so on that previously were hidden and often outweigh the benefits of promotions Eliminate Gaming in Shortage Situations instead of allocating products based on orders, it can allocate in proportion to past sales records sharing of capacity and inventory information helps to alleviate customers' anxiety and, consequently, lessen their need to engage in gaming adjust production capacity or scheduling with better knowledge of product demand manufacturers work with customers to place orders well in advance of the sales season enforce more stringent cancellation policies to discourage exaggerating their needs and cancel orders which aggravates gaming []{#_Toc9463707 .anchor}Making a Big Bet in Operations Options in improving operations: 1. Create a new process 2. Incrementally improve an existing process 3. Make a large bet to leapfrog the current operational model 4. Retrench to eliminate costly spare capacity Incrementally improve an existing process Fail early, cheaply and often great incremental path to success, especially when it comes to building the right production process Make a large bet to leapfrog the current operational model Reasons to make a big bet: When equipment to standardize operations will greatly reduce overall costs When costs per unit decline as production volume increases When bundling tasks appeals to customers When size strengthens bargaining power with suppliers and customers When a large leap could discourage new entrants When the costs of a customer defecting are high Ways to Make a Large Operations Leap 1. Lower production costs for existing demand 2. Remove several potential bottlenecks at once. 3. Add an additional production line. 4. Find a new primary process. 5. Embrace a disruptive technology. 6. Go up or down the value chain. 7. Clone geographically. 8. Embrace an entirely new business model. Danger Signs When Considering Big Bets 1. When there's no real advantages to size. 2. When customers are easily lured away by competitors. 3. When a leap adds complexity. 4. When a price war is inevitable. 5. When you have to take on debt. Alternatives to Making a Big Leap Don't feel compelled to take a large leap when it isn't necessary. Outsourcing and refocusing provide alternatives to large, potentially risky investments. Outsource as a Test: Often capacity additions can first be outsourced until demand, new processes or new technology are proven. Say you see a profitable opportunity to expand and don't want to let it pass you by, but the cost of the added capacity could sink the company if you bet wrong. Before you place that big order for machinery, look for a job shop, supplier, or customer with spare capacity. That way you can speed up response time and lower your risks until you have proven the process or market. Of course, outsourcing carries its own risks. Your external provider may not share your standards and commitment to quality. There may be risk in sharing your confidential processes and data. Your provider may drop the ball and fail to deliver on time, cost, and target. Know what you're getting into. Refocus: Some opportunities are ephemeral. In some cases, as your competitors rush to expand, you may be wise to go the other way and refocus. Is there a more profitable segment of your customers that you can focus on? Are there some unprofitable customers you need to fire? It's counterintuitive, but sometimes shrinking revenues leads to stronger and lower-risk free cash flows for you. {width=\"6.5in\" height=\"1.8423611111111111in\"} Making the Decision: start with your current situation. a. Given the current operational setup and constraints, how much free cash flow will your firm generate over the next few years if you forego the big bet to pursue an incremental approach? b. Be sure to take into account how quickly your market is growing, the barriers you have to keep out competitors, and your ability to incrementally add capacity by removing bottlenecks c. Factor in the increases in cash flow that might occur when you reach capacity if you raise prices or fire troublesome customers and replace them with more profitable ones, and conversely the likelihood and impact of luring in a new competitor d.

[Entrepreneurs need to do three things well:]{.underline} sell to customers make and deliver products or services count the cash that's left over at the end of the day The Cash and Valuation Framework provides the questions you need to make investment, operational, and financial decisions that will maximize the value of the firm and your equity. The Framework is broken into two major parts: 1. Adding value to your business Making incremental investments Creating a more complex business model Adding financing 2. Knowing when to sell. {width=\"6.272224409448819in\" height=\"4.918604549431321in\"} In a way, the progression of the C&V framework mirrors the evolution of a business: As an entrepreneur, you'll first make sunk investments for assets like machinery and commitments to fixed period costs like rent to get the business started. You will be eager to reach cash flow breakeven and payout as soon as possible. As the business grows, you may offer customer credit or add inventories or make new expenditures to grow, all of which create a more complex business model. Once the business model is proven, you may want to add debt to lower your cost of capital; If you have outside investors or run a public company, you'll need to use financial statements to report economic reality to outsiders; and One day, if someone offers you a market price that's more than you believe the business is worth, you may sell the business. Cash Flow Tools The most powerful way to visualize the attractiveness of a business is to project the amount of cold, hard cash the business will produce over time. An entrepreneur calls these cash flows. Valuation Tools Cash flows show you the story of the business's cash over time.The valuation tools in the C&V Framework allow you to calculate the value of a given business opportunity. Defining Value Value = Cash + Risk + Time Sahlman's Four Rules of Cash: 1) More cash is better than less cash. 2) Cash sooner is better than cash later. 3) Less-risky cash is better than more-risky cash. 4) Never run out of cash. The Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) tool will allow you to compare different scenarios of revenue, investments, and costs forecasts by visualizing how each decision will affect the amount of cash your business will create over time. Intrinsic Firm Value measures the value of the firm you have created, based on the FCFF discounted for the time value of money and risk. Free Cash Flow to the Equity (FCFE) models show how much free cash flow is left over for equity holders after interest and principal payments to debtors have been paid. Intrinsic Equity Value the value of the equity based on your free cash flow to the firm projections, is calculated by deducting the market value of the debt from the intrinsic firm value Four Key Principles for the Cash and Valuation Course: Focus your analysis on counting real customers and tangible products. Act like a financial detective, using the questions and tools in this framework to decipher what is happening on the factory floor or within the sales force. Count products and customers. Learn to think of inventory not as a number on a balance sheet but envision it 9 as piles of raw materials or semi-finished goods stacked on the factory floor. Imagine accounts receivable as individual IOUs written by customers. Always begin with adding value to one customer at a time. Start every analysis by determining how you add value, one customer and one sale at a time. The early questions and tools in this framework work best for simple businesses, but they also are the critical first steps for analyzing a highly complex business. You must master the simple tools and skills first before moving to the more complex. Be clear about which question you are asking before you reach for a financial tool. Often students will learn one financial tool and try to use it, no matter what the circumstances. The cash flow modeling and valuation tools presented in the course are each designed to answer specific questions. Do not choose an analytical tool until your goals and the question you are asking is crystal clear. Decide how much weight to put on historical data to drive forecasts. Projections require data. You either can forecast results based on trends in historical data from financial statements or from a bottom-up projection based on the customers, processes, and expected competitive environment in your business (unit economics). Your approach will likely depend on the quality of the data you have and whether you expect imbedded trends to continue or change. The Goal: The main goal of the Cash & Valuation Framework is to help you make the firm and your equity in it as valuable as possible, by building an economic model for your business that is as attractive as possible and can be executed by you in the real world. []{#_Toc9463711 .anchor}Searching for the Mythical Numbers Guru [The overarching financial question for running your own entrepreneurial business is]{.underline}: How do you maximize the long-term value of your equity while minimizing the risk of running out of cash while accurately reporting the results to outside parties? Why Can't You Just Hire a Numbers Guru? So why can't you just hire a \"numbers guru\" to handle all the financial issues? This sounds appealing---until you realize that there are four distinct numeracy skills that you need to run a business and that few \"financial gurus\" are experts in more than one of these areas. Financial gurus come in one of four basic flavors: Auditors, who measure historical expenditures so you can reward the right employee behaviors and accurately report your results to third parties Controllers, who project how changes in prices, sales volume, and fixed-period and variable costs will affect profits and (more importantly) free cash flows Tax experts, who know how to use the intricacies of Internal Revenue Code to minimize tax bills Money raisers, who persuade equity investors or banks to advance funds You, as the entrepreneur, must understand the basics in each of these areas so that you can ask the right questions to ensure you do not have an auditor, a controller, a tax expert, or a money raiser in the wrong position, leading you down a path to ruin. Learning the Hard Way \"On the Job\" As an entrepreneur, you have to stand between the sales department and the operations department to make difficult choices about which customers to serve, which process to use to serve them, and what prices to charge. Solving the financial challenges you will face will require a combination of financial accounting, cost accounting, tax, and money-raising skills, so you cannot delegate them to someone who has only mastered one set of tools. Numeracy is the ability to use numbers to solve a problem in a business. You can pick these skills up through on-the-job experience, with the caveat that you may bankrupt a company in the process. Below is a description of how you can expect your financial literacy to develop if you decide to learn at the \"school of hard knocks.\" You have three choices when it comes to numeracy: 1) You can avoid numerical literacy by sticking to small, cash-based businesses and grow them slowly, so unit economics is the only tool you will need. 2) Or you can learn the lessons the hard way, risking bankruptcy if you lose track of the connection between operating decisions, profitability, and free cash flows to equity, a danger that increases the more quickly you grow or the more heavily you finance with debt. 3) Or finally, you can put in the effort now to practice applying the tools of finance, first with simpler businesses and then with more-complex ones until you can run multiple scenarios to choose the one that adds the most value with the least risk. Never forget that your key objective in building a business is making the tough operating decisions that maximize the value to you and the other equity holders, while minimizing the risk of running out of cash. If you are ever confused, default to Sahlman's four rules of cash. The key to making smart financial decisions is asking the right questions, questions that can be answered from the data you have available. Unit economics may suffice early in the life of a business. Later on, when production processes, sales funnels, and cash cycles become more complex, you will need unlevered free cash flow to the firm to accurately project free cash flows. Free cash flows to the firm and intrinsic firm value come before intrinsic equity value and free cash flows to equity. Free cash flows to the firm depict cash flow projections for the whole pie and intrinsic firm value is the discounted present value of the whole pie. You must bake the pie before you divide it. Intrinsic equity value is the value of the pie that remains for owners, after the costs of debt have been subtracted. Free cash flows to equity tell you if there will be enough cash flow to satisfy fixed debt repayment obligations for interest and principal repayment that comes from debt. Intrinsic value comes before market price. You must know what something is worth to you before you contemplate selling it to someone else. Always seek to maximize the intrinsic value of the firm first. Then see how financing can increase the intrinsic value of your equity. Then, and only then, see if the market will pay you a price that is more than you think the future cash flows are worth. Even with the best financial modeling skills, predicting the future is an inexact science. Your balance sheets should balance and your cash flow projections should be mathematically correct. But far more important than precision is asking the right questions and using judgment to get \"close enough.\" This is no excuse for sloppy work. But, likewise, modeling skills are no substitute for the far rarer and more valuable gift of business judgment. You most have both modeling skills and real-world judgment. []{#_Toc9463712 .anchor}Principles of Cash and Valuation In this note, you will be introduced to Sahlman's Three Principles of Valuation: Principle One: Value = Cash + Risk + Time Principle Two: Sahlman's Four Rules of Cash 1. More cash is better than less cash. 2. Cash sooner is better than cash later. 3. Less-risky cash is better than more-risky cash. 4. NEVER run out of cash. Principle Three: Your goal in a valuation is to \"narrow the region of darkness,\" not calculate a precise value (which is impossible). Hard work and attention to your customers will close any gap between what you pay to acquire and develop an opportunity and what it's worth when you sell it. Remember, your goal in a valuation is not precision---it is setting a reasonable range of possible values. Hard work and satisfied customers will overcome any minor mistakes.

In other words, for simple businesses, it shows how changes in unit volume will affect revenues, expenses, profits and free cash flows. {width=\"6.484564741907262in\" height=\"4.953488626421697in\"} Which multiple do I use: 5x annual pre-tax cash flow is not always the right multiple depending on the predictability of the cash flows, interest rates, taxes, and a host of other factors. A multiple of five, however, is a good starting place. A multiple of pre-tax cash flows is an excellent proxy for valuation for a simple business, in normal times, but can give misleading results if: A firm's revenues are growing quickly, and the business model of the firm requires reinvesting operating cash flows in working capital or capital expenditures to support continued revenue growth. A firm has substantial fixed assets that are depreciating---in other words, wearing out as items are produced or deteriorating with the passage of time. A firm has a legal form resulting in tax rates that differ from those of alternative investments. The goal is to value the equity (owner's share) of a firm with debt rather than the entire firm itself.

Or you can deeply examine the different needs of each customer segment, count the number of customers in each segment, and use a sales funnel to predict how quickly leads will turn into paying customers. Projecting future revenues by extrapolating past sales has its advantages. Sales in previous years may reflect deeply embedded customer habits that are likely to continue. Unfortunately, such trends can be difficult to decipher if sales have been erratic. Do you use the past ten years as the basis for your predictions? The past five? Perhaps just the past two? Without understanding the reasons why customers buy your products, it is difficult to explain aberrations in historical data or to know which trends should be honored. Your own optimism (or pessimism) or some preconceived idea may affect which data you pay attention to instead of the trend that best predicts future performance. Understanding what drives the behavior of your customers, dividing them into segments that reflect different needs, counting how many are in each market, and building the right sales funnel to move them along in the sales process can provide far more accurate short-term sales predictions. It is the only choice you have in a start-up business when there are no trends to project. The drawback to such a thorough study, however, is that it is difficult to query large numbers of customers. Also, projections that extend beyond the leads and prospects already in your sales funnel can be little more than educated guesses. Projecting the Past: Extrapolating Historical Results {width=\"6.5in\" height=\"8.50763888888889in\"} {width=\"5.581395450568679in\" height=\"7.3130588363954505in\"} As you can see, the data you choose to include has a dramatic effect on projections and can be influenced by your level of optimism, which has nothing to do with the choices that will be made by real customers. {width=\"6.5in\" height=\"5.250694444444444in\"} Using Unit Economics to Project Revenues If forecasting future revenues by extrapolating past sales is like bombing from 30,000 feet, unit economics is like hand-to-hand combat. With unit economics, you try to crawl inside the head of your customers to predict why they will buy. This gives you a better understanding of the relationship between markets, price per unit, and unit volume, which may lead to more-accurate revenue predictions. Step One: Judging the Intensity of a Need Step Two: Measuring the Tradeoffs Between Substitutes {width=\"4.799458661417323in\" height=\"3.383720472440945in\"} Step Three: Judging the Size of and Penetration Rates for Your Market Step Four: Using Sales Funnels to Forecast Revenues Summary: Projecting revenues, even when done well, often is little more than an educated guess. Projecting revenues is easier when you have a long string of year over year sales increases, showing strong evidence of hordes of customers with deeply ingrained habits that will keep them coming back time and again. You feel more confident when you have a deep understanding of your market, so you understand on a customer-by-customer basis what each person values, which substitutes are available, and the optimum price point that will contribute the maximum contribution per dollar at risk. But even firms with the best market research and most loyal customers can be pleasantly surprised by consumer fads or long periods of economic prosperity. Even firms with the most transparent and forward-looking sales funnels are blindsided by disruptive technologies, irrational moves by competitors, or unexpected downturns in the economy. Learning to make reasonable projections of future revenues, either by projecting past results into the future or building sales projections unit by unit through unit economics (or preferably both), will allow you to compare the commitments you must make to build capacity and assess the risk of not having enough revenues to cover your fixed-period costs and recover your investments. The best defense against the unpredictability of revenues is to stage investments whenever possible, making the minimum sunk investments and fixed-period commitments for different levels of production, provided you allow enough time to add additional capacity when necessary.

Time and again we find entrepreneurs who make large sunk investments, certain that customers will want their product, only to find that a market never existed. Starting with the Customer How you have chosen your customer, your primary sunk investment, and the \"units\" you produce and deliver, will be the difference between success and failure. Unit Economics is a framework to help you make the very best choices possible. An entrepreneur once defined profit as \"over-recovered\" fixed cost. In Unit Economics, you learn to correctly define the sunk investments and fixed costs your venture will require. Then you will see if you are likely to attract enough customers who will buy enough \"units\" at a high enough price to make the investment worthwhile. And you will learn to do all of this before you make the sunk investment. Bridging the Gap Between Demand and Supply An entrepreneur matches a set of needs with the specifications for a product that satisfies that need. The glue that holds these two \"units\" together is the benefit you offer to the customer when using your product---a product that must be better, faster, or cheaper than any other way of satisfying that need. The combination of the \"unit of desire\" inside the customer, the \"unit of production\" given to the shop foreman, and the benefit the customer gets from using the product, successfully bridges the gap and forms the foundation of your business. This is the framework of unit economics. Demand: Customers, Prices, and Volumes You always start with a customer need and what the customer is willing to pay to satisfy it. But this answer is too simple. You cannot survey every customer, ask them what they want, and customize a solution. The cost of discovery and customization is too great. You need to find a group of customers with relatively homogeneous needs. [How do you determine a price?]{.underline} Quantify the maximum value your customer places on your product . This is the highest possible price you could charge (because no one would buy it after that). Measure your costs per unit. (Costs can vary depending on volume, but we'll get to that later. For now, choose a volume and measure cost per unit at that volume). The difference between the max value and the cost per unit is the \"shared value,\" because it's the total value of the product that must get divided up between you and the customer. Decide how much of the shared value you want to keep to yourself and how much you will give to the customer. Your price will be based on how much value you want to keep and concede. All of this works beautifully, until one little problem arises: a competing product or substitute of the same value starts selling for less. With no apparent difference in the value received by the customer, no customer will pay more for your product. So your new ceiling price is the price of the substitute. Decide again how much shared value you want to offer the customer and how much you want to keep, and you've determined your new price. {width=\"5.658536745406824in\" height=\"3.5287248468941383in\"} Value But how does a customer decide on the value of a product? Value is judged in the mind of an individual. The maximum price a customer will pay is set inside the mind of each consumer as they make subjective and sometimes irrational tradeoffs between the money they have, the intensity of the desires they wish to satisfy, {width=\"6.5in\" height=\"3.2729166666666667in\"} The Mistake of Using Costs to Set Prices Many people use a \"cost-plus\" approach to pricing because it is easier to calculate the costs of production than to crawl inside the heads of your customers to measure their whims. That is why this note started with you stumbling onto an empty pipeline, and why so many people take a \"build it and hope they will come\" approach. But setting prices based on costs is a mistake. If costs lead you to price below what your customers are willing to pay, you may give away too much value to the customer. If costs lead you to price above what your customers are willing to pay, you will not sell a single unit, and all of your costs will truly be \"sunk.\" Basing prices on costs can cause you to miss a lucrative opportunity. What is a Primary Sunk Investment? A primary sunk investment is: \u2022 The most important investment a company makes to satisfy its chosen set of customers. \u2022 Either the largest investment the company makes or the asset that would be the most expensive to duplicate. \u2022 A process or asset that allows a company to do the most important tasks again and again in the most efficient way possible to deliver exactly what the customer will pay for. \u2022 The single most important investment to: (1) invent a new product or create a new product; (2) attract customers; (3) manufacture a product; or (4) deliver a product. 15 It typically serves every customer in the same way. {width=\"6.5in\" height=\"4.685416666666667in\"} Summary Unit economics is about making sunk investments---primary sunk investments---where you are confident you can \"over-recover\" the investment to make a profit. When you start your business, it is critical to have defined your primary sunk investment, and the \"units\" its standardized process is designed to deliver. You must understand that the key attributes of these \"units of production\" are critical for satisfying the \"units of desire\" in your subset of customers, how many of these customers are likely to buy and what price they will pay. You then can calculate the variable and fixed period costs required to attract, make, and deliver these units, and how long it will take to recover your primary sunk investment and other start-up costs. All of business---from water pipelines to theme parks---is a matter of making and recovering sunk investments in a standardized set of processes. If you are clear about the \"units\" you are selling, and the primary sunk investment you have made, the chances are much higher that you will \"over recover\" your fixed and sunk costs and survive. []{#_Toc9463718 .anchor}Operating Leverage Understanding how operating leverage works will help you make better decisions with regard to sunk investments and fixed-period commitments. Look for opportunities to bootstrap your operations by keeping most costs variable until demand is proven. Doing this greatly lowers the risk of investing in fixed assets and making fixed-period commitments to add capacity or increase efficiency. Understanding how financial leverage works can help you add enough low-cost debt to boost equity returns, without adding so much that you risk bankrupting your company. Master the use of leverage and, like Archimedes, you'll have one more tool to help you change the world. Operating & Financial Leverage: \"Leverage\" in business describes the relationship between changes in revenues and changes in free cash flows, usually the result of a business model where every sale contributes a large amount toward high fixed period costs. Operating leverage Where as a result of the business model chosen, small changes in revenue will lead to large changes in operating profits and operating cash flows. Operating leverage can supercharge free cash flows if revenue's grow with the risk of bankrupting the firm if they don't. Financial leverage Where because of debt added to a firm, small changes in revenue will lead to large changes in net profits and free cash flows, independent of changes caused by operating leverage. Still don't understand operating leverage? Operating leverage describes how the addition of fixed-period costs in your business model makes operating profits and cash flows more sensitive to changes in revenue. If you choose to keep most costs variable, and fixed-period costs like salary and rent low, your business will survive periods of low sales for as long as you are willing to survive on little to no pay. Unfortunately, your ability to greatly expand sales will be severely limited and the contribution per sale (the amount left over from every sale once variable costs have been paid) will be low []{#_Toc9463719 .anchor}Monkey Ranch 2 []{#_Toc9463720 .anchor}Are You Smarter Than a 5^th^ Grader (Operating Leverage) []{#_Toc9463721 .anchor}Learning to Speak Financial Accounting Components of an Income Statement: {width=\"2.9069772528433946in\" height=\"1.8087860892388452in\"} COGS COGS stands for \"Cost of Goods Sold.\" This line reports all costs directly attributable to the production of the company's product. COGS includes raw material inputs as well as \"direct labor,\" labor applied to making the product. Most of the data from the manufacturing process winds up on this line. Gross Profit Subtracting COGS from Sales leaves Gross Profit. The company must cover its sales, general, and administrative costs out of this difference between total revenue and production costs. SG&A, or Sales, General, and Administrative These expenses, include costs associated with all sales and marketing activities---salaries for salespeople, advertising, and so on---as well as salaries for the company managers and other administrative expenses not directly attributable to sales or manufacturing operations. EBITDA Subtracting SG&A from Gross Profit leaves a measure of company profit called EBITDA ---an acronym that stands for \"earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization.\" For a simple business with no debt or financing, no depreciation on tools, and no taxes, EBITDA is the same thing as cash left over after all inputs, workers, managers, and suppliers have been paid. Put another way, EBITDA is the same thing as the unit economics pre-tax cash flow. Summary When you're considering an increase in sales or a new product launch or a big investment in production capacity, you'll want to do unit economics analysis---that is, to calculate contribution per unit to FPC, sales volume to breakeven on FPC, and how long it will take to recover the money spent on new equipment. Since businesses don't usually report costs and revenue in simple unit economics form, you must learn to get the numbers you need from financial reports, like the income statement. As you dig into an income statement to learn about a business, keep in mind that income statements typically organize information by division---that is, all costs associated with manufacturing will show up under COGS and all costs associated with sales (as well as general and administrative costs) will be under SG&A. Income statements do not distinguish variable from fixed period costs---the information you need to do unit economic analysis. Managers sometimes act as if COGS were \"variable costs\" and 8 SG&A were \"fixed costs.\" While COGS includes all the variable costs of making the product, it may also include fixed period costs such as labor or utilities directly related to manufacturing. In the same way SG&A may include variable costs---sales commissions, for instance---associated with selling the product. If you want to separate the fixed and variable components of COGS (and SG&A), you'll have to take a closer look at how the reported expenses change as sales volume changes. {width=\"7.157370953630796in\" height=\"6.8953488626421695in\"} {width=\"6.461919291338583in\" height=\"1.8604647856517935in\"} {width=\"4.277777777777778in\" height=\"5.208333333333333in\"} []{#_Toc9463722 .anchor}Monkey Ranch 3 []{#_Toc9463723 .anchor}Are You Smarter Than a 5^th^ Grader (COGS/SG&A) []{#_Toc9463724 .anchor}Standing In Between Demand & Supply The Emergence of Business Archetypes Over time, the combination of an entrepreneur's DNA, luck, and the decisions made early in the life of a business, begin to come together to form patterns in the way a business operates. In his Note on Developing Start-up Strategies, Professor Amar Bhide identifies seven cash flow \"archetypes\" that describe the risk and reward characteristics and sustainability of most opportunities. Businesses don't generally \"choose\" one of these strategies; they are developed through trial and error. But by studying the history of businesses that have similar archetypes, you may learn something about what to expect for your own choice of customers, \"units\" and primary sunk investment. [Solo Contracting Ventures]{.underline} A Solo Contracting business has little in the way of a primary sunk investment, differentiation from competitors or barriers to competition. Initial investments and risks are low; as are profit margins and rewards, and the profits continue only as long as the entrepreneur continues to \"hustle.\" It is difficult for an entrepreneur to sell a solo contracting business because it depends so much on the talents and energy of the entrepreneur to survive. In many ways, the entrepreneur does not own the business. It owns him. Lawn services, hairdressers, and other sole proprietors fit this archetype. Most entrepreneurial ventures in the United States are Solo Contracting businesses. [Revolutionary Ventures]{.underline} The Revolutionary archetype is the polar opposite of the Solo Contracting venture. Founders of Revolutionary Ventures typically make a very large primary sunk investment to deliver something radically different to a large group of customers. The risks are enormous and successes rare, but the potential rewards from a Federal Express or Compaq are large as well. Venture capitalists tend to fund Revolutionary Ventures. Other archetypes that fall between Solo Contracting and Revolutionary Ventures on the risk and reward spectrum are: [Institutional Hustle]{.underline} Institutionalized Hustle businesses include law firms, accounting firms, consulting firms, venture capitalists, and investment banking. This archetype is similar to the Solo Contracting archetype, except that there are marginal reasons for practitioners to band together, such as building a reputation or rent sharing. In rare cases, such as McKinsey & Co., there are work processes and training and recruiting protocols that qualify as primary sunk investments. Nevertheless, in most cases, investments and risks are low and profits limited when compared to other archetypes. 31 Like Solo Contractors, those in Institutionalized Hustle businesses thrive mainly because of their individual energy and talent. [Syndication Ventures]{.underline} The Syndication archetype relies on an entrepreneur to bring together various buyers or sellers to create a more efficient market. The size of the primary sunk investment depends on the size and breadth of the market being served. Risk varies depending on how difficult it is to find and convince players to participate. [Trading and Speculation Ventures]{.underline} The Trading and Speculation archetype applies to such industries as oil and gas, real estate, and securities trading. There is a large sunk investment, but it is typically not made in a primary sunk investment to service customers. Instead, entrepreneurs usually make short-term, contrary bets to profit from imbalances in commodity-like markets. [Speed Ventures]{.underline} Speed ventures involve the race to capture a new market created by rapidly changing consumer tastes or technology. Primary sunk investments must be made quickly with little information and few chances to perform methodical \"trial and error\" tests. Sustainability may also be low if the turbulence that led to the first opportunity continues and allows new entrants to leapfrog current competitors. [Niche Ventures]{.underline} In Niche Ventures, the entrepreneur chooses customers with unusual desires that aren't being well served by more standardized competitors. Primary sunk investments are usually limited because production runs and total market size are smaller. The potential rewards are lower than a Revolutionary Venture but may be sustained for long periods if competitors find the small market size unattractive. The best Niche Ventures are those that create sunk assets or processes that may be applied to other segments to create new opportunities. Wrapping Up Unit economics is about making sunk investments---primary sunk investments---where you are confident you can \"over-recover\" the investment to make a profit. When you start your business, it is critical to have defined your primary sunk investment, and the \"units\" its standardized process is designed to deliver. You must understand that the key attributes of these \"units of production\" are critical for satisfying the \"units of desire\" in your subset of customers, how many of these customers are likely to buy and what price they will pay. You then can calculate the variable and fixed period costs required to attract, make, and deliver these units, and how long it will take to recover your primary sunk investment and other start-up costs. All of business---from water pipelines to theme parks---is a matter of making and recovering sunk investments in a standardized set of processes. If you are clear about the \"units\" you are selling, and the primary sunk investment you have made, the chances are much higher that you will \"overrecover\" your fixed and sunk costs and survive. {width=\"6.5in\" height=\"2.723611111111111in\"} The following questions will guide you through these decisions with your own business: \u2022 What is the \"unit of desire?\" How do customers measure it? What are the key physical attributes that satisfy it? \u2022 What price per unit are they willing to pay? \u2022 How difficult will it be to find these customers and convince them to buy? 23 \u2022 What is my Primary Sunk Investment? How will it create value for my customers and a return for my investors? \u2022 How many customers can be reached or serviced by what my Primary Sunk Investment can deliver? \u2022 What are the variable costs to produce each \"unit?\" \u2022 How much in fixed period costs will it take to operate? \u2022 How long does it take to recover my investment? \u2022 How long can I keep competition from reducing my margins? \u2022 What options does this investment give me to make other attractive investments? []{#_Toc9463725 .anchor}Are You Smarter Than a 5^th^ Grader (EBITDA) []{#_Toc9463726 .anchor}Becoming a Financial Detective Three of the most important questions in business are: \u2022 How much cash will you need to invest in your business in the early years? \u2022 How much in excess free cash flow (cash that can be distributed to you and your investors) will your business produce in later years? \u2022 Will the cumulative value of the free cash flows provide enough reward for the time, energy, and investment you've put at risk? Historical Financial Statements The primary purposes of historical financial statements are to: (1) accurately report the financial performance of a business to third parties, and (2) collect a record of transactions so you can reward employees and detect fraud. Financial statements have three main parts: 1) Income statements which capture revenues and expenses so you can calculate and track gross and net profits over a period of time. 2) Balance sheets which record investments in assets and liabilities (financial promises) at a particular point in time. 3) Statements of cash flow which show how much cash has been generated by (or used in) operations, how much cash was used (or generated) by investing in (or selling) assets, and how much cash was provided by (or used to pay off) financings over a certain period of time Historical financial statements are designed to provide a financial record of what has happened in a business. So before you try to use them to make future projections, it's important to understand their drawbacks and limitations. For example: The past is no guarantee of the future. Past results cannot take into account changing customer preferences, surges in raw material costs, or irrational acts by competitors. Use the past to predict the future at your own risk. Historical revenues and expenses on the income statement are reported by function or department. Revenues and expenses on financial statements are collected based on the total expenditures by function or department, so there is no way to directly measure how unit volume, price per unit, variable costs, and fixed-period costs will affect profits and free cash flows. For example: a. Rising prices per unit may create short-term revenue gains, but they often mean that fewer customers will choose to buy in the future. Because the revenue line on an income statement merely reports dollars, there is no way to see how price per unit and unit volume are related. The relationship between decisions on the factory floor and showroom and working capital are obscured. Historical trends in working capital can show you how changes in credit extended to customers (accounts receivable), credit extended by suppliers to the company (accounts payable), or the raw materials requirements to keep the factory running were related to changes in revenues in the past but do not show how underlying economic relationships will drive future results. GAAP depreciation does not necessarily reflect economic reality. While GAAP conventions standardize reporting between companies and make it easier to compare one company's financials to another's, the GAAP depreciation show on your company's financial statements may not reflect the actual wear and tear that's occurring with your fixed assets. A Step-by-Step Guide for Creating an Unlevered Free Cash Flow to the Firm Model From Historical Financial Statements Step 1: Projecting Revenues No matter how much information you have, predicting future revenues is the most difficult task you face, because you have to forecast the actions of fickle customers and whether competitors will be successful in luring those customers away. {width=\"6.104477252843394in\" height=\"4.725752405949256in\"} If you use all the data points, sales appear to be gently climbing. If you use the last four years of data, sales are flat. If you assume the dip in sales in 2006 was an aberration and use the data only from 2004 and 2005, sales seem to be rising quickly. Use only the data from the last two years and sales seem to be plunging. Step 2: Projecting Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) and Sales, General, and Administrative (SG&A) Expenses Of course, you would prefer to know more about Wiley's sales funnel, manufacturing process and general administrative functions, so you could project how the total average cost per unit actually change with unit volume. 5 But if all you have are historical financial statements, the best you can do is infer relationships between revenue and fixed-period and variable costs from previous years, function by function. [There are three steps for projecting future expenses based on historical financial statements:]{.underline} 1. Restate revenue increases in terms of annual percentage increases and common sizing expenses. 2. Tease out fixed-period and variable cost relationships. There are two approaches for estimating the fixed-period and variable cost relationships from historical data when both are present: 1. Graphically (Draw a best-fit curve that describes the relationship between revenues and expenses). 2. The High-Low method (which takes revenue and expense readings at two different points in time and mathematically describes a fixed-period and variable relationship between the two points). 3. Project expenses as a percentage of future revenues. Step 3: Calculating Gross Profits and EBITDA At this point, you decide that Wiley's historical revenues are just too volatile to make any reliable projections of the future. Roadrunner Enterprises seem much more predictable, so you decide to proceed with making unlevered free cash flow to the firm projections for Roadrunner (you remind yourself that Roadrunner's smooth historical growth in revenues is no guarantee of the future, and resolve to dig more deeply into its customer needs and markets before making any sort of offer.) {width=\"6.5in\" height=\"2.171527777777778in\"} The next step in projecting free cash flows to the firm is deducting COGS from revenues to calculate gross profits, and then subtracting SG&A from gross profits to determine the firm's EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization). Note that EBITDA is the same as the annual pre-tax cash flow from unit economics, except that for unit economics the expenses are tracked by variable and fixed-period costs rather than department and function.

Since you haven't yet spent any money on a new machine, this is a \"noncash charge.\" In other words, you are making a note to remind yourself that profits aren't as large as EBITDA suggests and that eventually you will have to buy a new machine. Remember, however, that GAAP has designed financial statements so that the profits from one business can be compared with another's. Allowing each business owner to make a different estimate for depreciation leaves too many chances to manipulate profits, so GAAP has decided how much depreciation you can deduct for certain assets. Unfortunately, these GAAP conventions may bear only a passing relationship to real (economic) depreciation, so your financial statements li {width=\"6.5in\" height=\"5.565972222222222in\"} {width=\"6.5in\" height=\"1.3770833333333334in\"} Step 5: Estimating Federal Income Taxes {width=\"6.2717694663167105in\" height=\"4.802325021872266in\"} {width=\"5.650608048993876in\" height=\"5.476744313210848in\"} Step 6: Checking Trends in Revenue Growth, Gross Margins, and Net Margins for the Effects of Competition It's time to step back from the projections of revenues and costs to take an explicit look at revenue growth rates and gross and net margins. How have revenues and gross and net margins historically changed over time? How do your projections suggest they will change in the future? {width=\"4.883720472440945in\" height=\"2.3312445319335082in\"} {width=\"6.5in\" height=\"4.475in\"} Of course, at this point you wish you had a competitive analysis and a deep understanding of unit economics to more fully inform your projections, but you don't.

If you have a dollar today, you can invest it and earn interest, leaving you with more than a dollar tomorrow. Plus, there's always the chance that tomorrow's dollar may not arrive as promised. The higher the interest rate and the greater the risk, the more valuable the dollar today is by comparison to a dollar tomorrow. An entrepreneur needs to learn to value a business by projecting revenues, expenses, and investments into the future using unlevered Free Cash Flow to the Firm (uFCFF) models. The pattern and timing of the annual free cash flows of a firm will give you a general sense of the value of a business but, if you want a direct way to compare two opportunities, you will need a mathematical formula to weigh the value of a dollar of cash flow in future years with the value of a dollar today. This note describes how to choose a discount rate that will allow you to systematically adjust the value of the Future Free Cash Flows of a Firm to account for the time value of money and the risk that the cash flows will not appear. What's the right discount rate to use for a firm's free cash flows? That depends on how much interest you could earn from an alternative \"risk free\" investment and the added risk of the particular business. Calculating the right discount rate is as much an art as a science and will take you many years to master, but this note will give you some rules of thumb to use as you gain real\u00adworld experience. +-----------------+-----------------+-----------------+-----------------+ | | Capital Asset | Venture | Buffet's 9% | | | Pricing Model | Capital | | | | (CAPM) | Valuation | | | | | Method | | +=================+=================+=================+=================+ | Definition | Uses the past | Use multiples* | Flat 9% | | | instability of | from initial | discount rate, | | | the prices of a | investment | regardless of | | | publicly traded | (e.g., 10x, | | | | stock as a | 20x, 30x) at | current | | | proxy for | time of exit | interest rates, | | | future risk and | | inflation | | | uses this to | *The | expectations, | | | adjust the | price-earnings | or the risk | | | risk-free rate | multiple is the | associated with | | | to determine a | value that the | an investment | | | discount rate | public markets | | | | | place on the | Over the long | | | | earnings of a | run, annual | | | | company.

It is the premium over nominal returns that an investor should expect to receive for bearing the risk of an investment What Is a Discount Rate? A discount rate can be defined as \"the rate of return required by an investor to accept the risks of a certain investment.\" Unfortunately, this becomes a circular definition if you want to use discounted cash flow analysis to value a firm because you will not have good market comparables to calculate the returns required by investors. This means you must use a variety of ways to estimate the returns that an investor might demand. The Preferred Method: Adding a Risk Premium to a Risk\u00adFree Rate The simplest and most direct method for calculating a discount rate is to estimate separately the risk\u00adfree rate alternatives available to an investor and the risk premium that he or she might require to choose this particular investment opportunity. The Risk\u00ad Free Rate A close proxy for a risk \u00adfree rate is the return offered by a US government security that has the same time horizon as the investment in question. If you expect the cash flows from a business to last for five years, look up the five\u00adyear U.S. Treasury bond yield in the Wall Street Journal. If the investment has a ten\u00ad year time horizon, use the yield on ten\u00ad year Treasury bonds. Adjusting for Risk Adjusting for risk is more difficult because it's hard to find exact comparables. One method, and a rather inexact one, is to add a fixed discount rate premium that differs depending on the predictability of the cash flows of the business. The discount rate for the uFCFF of a large stable company might suggest adding 5% to the risk \u00adfree rate while the discount rate for the uFCFF for a small, risky start\u00adup might require a 15% or larger risk premium. Additional risk premiums may be needed to adjust for private 2 (illiquid) companies, industry \u00adspecific risks and the risks to individual companies {width=\"4.527777777777778in\" height=\"2.5555555555555554in\"} Warning! This approach for estimating discount rates is little more than a rough guess. Some large companies can have fickle customers. Some have high fixed \u00adperiod operating costs, where even modest drops in revenues can lead to dramatic reductions in free cash flow. In others, intense competition can lead to rapidly shrinking margins. The uFCFF projections of such businesses, whether large, midsized or small, would be highly uncertain and would require adding higher risk premiums than shown in the table above. Unfortunately, until you have analyzed the unlevered FCFF patterns of scores of businesses in a number of contextual environments, vague approximations like those above will have to do. Don't Compare Apples to Oranges when Matching Discount Rates to Free Cash Flows One of the biggest mistakes when discounting free cash flows is to choose a discount rate that doesn't match the character of the cash flows you are discounting. For example, uFCFF discount rates, by definition, are designed to measure the risk of a firm with no debt. It is incorrect to apply a discount rate designed to measure the risk of the cash flows of a firm to the riskier stream of cash flows for the equity owners after preferential payments to debt holders have been made. When you add debt to a company, debt holders usually demand to receive interest and principal payments before equity holders receive a share of cash flows. Adding large fixed payments of interest and principal (financial leverage) means that even small changes in revenues can lead to large swings in equity free cash flows (particularly if the firm also has high fixed period operating costs). So discount rates for a firm's unlevered cash flows cannot be used to value an owner's equity free cash flows after debt payments have been subtracted. In fact, equity discount rates for highly leveraged transactions are often so high that the compounding effect of the risk premium begins to distort the value of free cash flows in later years. As a result, when trying to calculate the intrinsic value of equity, it is generally better to discount the uFCFF, add the discounted value of the tax shield, and then subtract the market value of the debt. For calculating equity values for 4 companies with extreme amounts of debt, it may even make sense to treat the equity value as an option that has value only in the event that the firm survives a crippling debt load Comparing the Combined Discount Rate With Other Market Proxies The discount rate used to discount the unlevered free cash flows for your firm, calculated by adding a risk premium to the risk\u00adfree rate, can be compared with the returns demanded for similarly risky investments as a sanity check. For example, assume you are trying to value a medium\u00adsized company with a ten\u00adyear time horizon. You note that risk\u00adfree rates for ten\u00adyear Treasury bonds are trading at a 5% yield so, 4 The Internal Revenue Service treats interest expenses as a tax\u00addeductible expense. This means that tax payments go down as interest payments rise. The value created by these foregone tax payments is called the \"tax shield.\" 3 following the preceding example, you add a 10% risk premium to calculate a 15% discount rate for the firm's unlevered free cash flows. But then you note that the senior secured bonds of similar companies are trading at a 15% yield. 5 Since the senior debt holders must be paid first, the senior secured bonds should have a lower interest rate than the discount rate for the unlevered company, so there must be more operating risk in the company than you assumed. Likewise, adding 15% to the 5% yield offered by Treasuries for a small high\u00adtech startup may not be enough of a risk premium if the NASDAQ has just crashed and it is next to impossible to raise new funds for such companies. Other Approaches to Discount Rates Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) The Weighted Average Cost of Capital method (WACC) was developed to give employees in large firms a common discount rate for evaluating internal investment opportunities. Without WACC, each division manager would have to set his or her own discount rate for internal projects, leading to a haphazard internal allocation of capital. WACC estimates the portion of a firm's internal cost of funds attributable to debt and equity separately and then combines them. For the debt portion, WACC uses the average interest rate paid by the firm for debt, adjusted for the value of the tax shield and weighted for the amount of debt in the company. For the equity contribution to the discount rate, WACC takes the equity returns demanded by stockholders, weighted by the amount of equity in the company's capital structure. For example, a company with a 34% tax rate and debt equal to 40% of its firm value, paying a 10% interest rate, with a cost of equity of 20%, would have a WACC of 15%. {width=\"3.837209098862642in\" height=\"1.9488659230096237in\"} WACC works as a discount rate proxy for the internal investment decisions of large firms with stable capital structures. Because it requires an estimate of the cost of equity, which is difficult to 5 Junk bonds are high\u00adrisk, unsecured loans that are similar in risk profile to equity for highly leveraged companies. 4 determine for non\u00adpublic companies, it is less useful for choosing discount rates for levered Free Cash Flows to the Firm for companies with debt in their capital structure. Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) The Capital Asset Pricing Model estimates the discount rates for assets based on the historical relationship between the volatility of stock prices and the subsequent returns for investors in these stocks. CAPM is based on the risk\u00adfree rate demanded by investors, the risk premium investors require to invest in the market, and an added risk premium that reflects the riskiness of an individual company. CAPM Discount Rate = Risk\u00adfree rate + Beta (Market rate -- Risk\u00adfree rate) For CAPM, the risk premium associated with an individual company, called Beta, is based on the historical volatility of the company's stock price. CAPM is widely used in academia but shunned by most in the real world. The idea of using past volatility to forecast future risk doesn't make sense if you are an entrepreneur who has an in \u00addepth understanding of their customers, cost structure, and competitors. Using the logic of CAPM, if the stock of an excellent company with strong cash flows had recently fallen 90%, it would now be more risky, and thus a worse investment, than before its stock price fell. Summary Discount rates offer a way to adjust the value of future annual free cash flows to the present, taking into account the time value of money and risk. As with most valuation issues, the key to discount rates is to get \"close enough\" and to make reasonable assumptions about future free cash flows. Discount rates can be estimated as a combination of a risk\u00adfree rate to compensate investors for the time value of their money and a risk premium that investors will demand in order to invest in a firm like yours (a firm with your customers, your operating leverage and your competitors). 6 A discount rate must be matched to the character of the cash flows that are being discounted. Discount rates for uFCFF cannot be used to discount the firm value or equity of a firm that has debt. Because of the volatility of equity cash flows and the distorting effect of extreme discount rates on later year cash flows, it is generally better to estimate an intrinsic equity value by first discounting the uFCFF, then adding back the tax shield savings as a result of interest payments and subtracting the market value of the debt. Other discount rate approaches, like WACC and CAPM, are not intended for estimating the future value of an entrepreneurial firm and should not be used for this purpose. In general, use discount rates that reflect (as closely as possible) the returns your investors will demand to invest in your business. Then, seek to \"narrow the region of darkness\" to estimate the Intrinsic Value of your firm by running various revenue and cost projections of the uFCFF (including different terminal values) and discount these to the present to compare the present value of the firm under different scenarios. Warren Buffet's 9% Discount Rate The famous long-term investor Warren Buffett reportedly uses a 9% discount rate, regardless of current interest rates, inflation expectations, or the risk associated with an investment. On the surface, this seems preposterous; especially since long-term interest rates and inflation expectations fluctuate widely. Further inspection shows that wisdom often comes in simple packages. Buffett knows that over the long run, annual real returns and inflation have averaged approximately 3% each. In using a 9% discount rate, Buffett is saying that in the long run he believes that nominal rates will average 6% and he wants to make an additional 3% return to compensate him for his investing genius. Buffett uses a consistent discount rate to tell him when to invest and when to sit on the sidelines. In \"good times,\" when inflation is low and too much money is chasing deals, Buffett's discount rate will be too high, and he will be unable to find any interesting investments because others will outbid him. In times when inflation is high or money is hard to find, Buffett's 9% discount rate will lead him to be aggressive, and since there will be few other bidders, he will have his pick of investments that give him the highest net present value at a 9% discount rate. Buffett's Secret: Reflecting Risk on His Free Cash Flow Projections Staying with a 9% discount rate allows Buffett to avoid speculative booms and take advantage of the inevitable speculative busts that follow. Unlike with the Venture Capital Method, by using only a small premium over real interest rates and inflation, Buffett does not use discount rates as a proxy for risk. Instead, he adjusts for risk by projecting more-accurate free cash flows, running multiple scenarios, and using debt and options to make sure that in all but the worst-case scenarios, he is likely to recover his investment. Those who use the CAPM or the Venture Capital Method are estimating risks from 30,000 feet, using analytical cleverness to avoid understanding the nuts and bolts of a business. Buffett revels in the nuts and bolts, understanding in simple terms why customers buy, how products are made and delivered, and how competitors can be kept at bay. If Buffett can make a 6% real rate of return over a long period of time, he will own an even larger piece of the world than he does now. A Warning About Using A 9% Discount Rate Remember that Warren Buffett has a lifelong track record of understanding the fundamental risks of a business. He avoids businesses that he does not understand or that do not allow him to adjust for the overconfidence of the forecaster. If you use a 9% discount rate and are unable to adjust overly optimistic cash flows back to reality, you will tend to overvalue opportunities. Buffett's method is not an excuse to blindly increase your valuation by using a low discount rate but instead is an admonition to learn more about the customers, cost structure, and competitive environment of the business you are studying Summary High-powered analysts run endless spreadsheets to calculate betas. Reportedly gifted venture capitalists use discount rates of 50% to 75% to value an opportunity. Could such approaches be misguided? There is a difference between cleverness and wisdom. Fancy theories and mathematical formulas may make you feel smarter, but they are dangerous tools when used to avoid a common sense understanding of the opportunity you are analyzing. Warren Buffett's reported use of a 9% discount rate is simple, but not simplistic. It gives him an unwavering sense of whether markets are exuberant or depressed and---provided that his analysis of fundamental cash flows is sound---provides an accurate estimate of value. Understand the fundamentals of a business. Run multiple free cash flow projections. Use convertible debt or other types of options to protect yourself from downside cases and invest only when the market is pessimistic about the future---and you can be wise too. []{#_Toc9463732 .anchor}Estimating Terminal Values What Is a Terminal Value? This note introduces the concept of a terminal value, a way to combine the later year cash flows of a business into a single lump sum, so you can more easily determine the value of the business today. As the owner of a business, you are entitled to the free cash flows of a business in perpetuity. But, practically speaking, after a certain point your projections seem to be little more than a wild guess. You don't want to give away these final years of your firm's free cash flows for nothing, but you aren't quite sure how to include them in your valuation model. Terminal Values help with this dilemma by giving you a short hand way to lump the free cash flows beyond a certain date into the final year of your free cash flow projections. This lump sum is then discounted back to the present to determine its value to you today. Terminal Values are---at best---an educated guess, but even if your crystal ball is cloudy, the free cash flows that occur beyond your projection period will likely be worth something. It's your job to account for this value as best you can. +-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+ | | EBITDA multiple | Perpetuity with | | | method | Growth (PWG) method | | | | | | | (multiple free cash | (extrapolating | | | flows) | stable CF growth far | | | | into the future) | +=======================+=======================+=======================+ | Definition | Uses a proxy for the | Terminal value is | | | free cash flow | calculated by taking | | | generating capacity | the UFCFF in the year | | | of the firm (EBITDA) | following the | | | in the terminal | terminal year and | | | | dividing it by the | | | year, and multiplies | difference between | | | it by a number meant | the discount rate and | | | to represent what a | the annual expected | | | buyer at that point | growth rate of the | | | in time might | after-tax | | | | | | | pay for the right to | uFCFF | | | all free cash flows | | | | to come | Terminal Value (PWG) | | | | = (Annual Free Cash | | | Terminal value | Flow to the Firm the | | | (EBITDA multiple) = | year after the | | | EBITDA multiple X the | terminal year) / | | | EBITDA in the | | | | terminal year | (After-Tax Discount | | | | Rate -- Stabilized | | | | Growth Rate of the | | | | firm's free cash | | | | flows) | +-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+ | Multiples | -

There is no easy answer to the question of how far you should project the free cash flows of a firm before you stop to estimate a terminal value. Theoretically, you would prefer to forecast the individual components of revenue, expenses, and investments until you have saturated your market and your revenue growth tracks the growth rate of the overall economy. In practice, however, few businesses survive that long without experiencing some shock due to contextual changes or competition, so long-lived cash flow projections may be unrealistic. So once you reach the limits of your ability to make credible estimates of revenues, expenses, and investments (the terminal year), it is time to stop making discrete forecasts of annual free cash flows and instead lump all cash flows beyond the final year into a single \"terminal value\" that can be added to the final year's operating cash flow. As shown in the example below, if a business (Business A) is well established with loyal customers, a large potential market, few substitutes, a stable cost structure, and benign competitive pressures, you may project free cash flows for as long as ten years before summing all subsequent free cash flows into a terminal value. In other cases (Business B) you may believe that you will saturate a market and reach a point of diminishing returns on sales growth within five years or less, so your terminal value calculation may come much sooner. {width=\"5.779069335083115in\" height=\"3.982988845144357in\"} What Methods Can You Use to Compute a Terminal Value? There are several different approaches you can take for estimating a terminal value. All implicitly take into account the future growth in revenues, expenses, and investments and prevailing interest rates in the terminal year. Two of the most popular approaches are using a multiple of free cash flows (the EBITDA Multiple method) and extrapolating stable cash flow growth far into the future (the Perpetuity with Growth method.) EBITDA Multiple Method The EBITDA Multiple method uses a proxy for the free cash flow generating capacity of the firm (EBITDA - earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) in the terminal year, and multiplies it by a number meant to represent what a buyer at that point in time might pay for the right to all free cash flows to come. Terminal value (EBITDA multiple) = EBITDA multiple X the EBITDA in the terminal year. How large a multiple is reasonable? It depends on how long you expect the cash flows to continue at the current rate. If your business is predicted to have reasonably strong competitive barriers and steady sales, in a normal interest rate environment a multiple of 5X EBITDA might be reasonable. In other words, a buyer might pay you five times the pre-tax cash flow to the firm in the final year of the projections because he or she believes that the cash flows would continue at this level (or higher) for enough time (at least five years) for the investment to be attractive. If your company is a service business with few barriers and interest rates are abnormally high, a multiple of as little as 2X to 3X EBITDA may be reasonable. In this case, a buyer may believe that the cash flows are so fragile that they may not continue beyond a few years or so. Likewise, if interest rates are low and the company has extremely high barriers to competition, some analysts use EBITDA multiples of 8X to 10X or even higher. Here, the cash flows from the business look so steady, and the returns from alternative investment choices are so low, that a buyer will place a much higher value on the terminal year cash flow. {width=\"4.383720472440945in\" height=\"2.0530096237970255in\"} Warning: EBITDA multiples work best for estimating a terminal value for businesses that have stable revenues and margins. It does not work well for fast-growing businesses, particularly those with operating leverage, heavy working capital investments or recurring capital expenditures. Perpetuity With Growth Method (PWG) With the Perpetuity with Growth method, the terminal value is calculated by taking the Unlevered Free Cash Flow to the Firm in the year following the terminal year and dividing it by the difference between the discount rate and the annual expected growth rate of the after-tax uFCFF. Terminal Value (PWG) = (Annual Free Cash Flow to the Firm the year after the terminal year) / (After-Tax Discount Rate -- Stabilized Growth Rate of the firm's free cash flows) In essence, this formula is calculating the perpetual value of a stream of after-tax cash flows, rising at a steady rate, relative to the after-tax cost of funds (the discount rate). For example, assume your firm's after-tax cash flow stream from a business was \\$1 million in the year after the terminal year. You believe that the after-tax free cash flows to the firm will grow at 5% a year forever and that the correct after-tax discount rate is 10%. Terminal Value (PWG) = \\$1 million / (.10 -- .05) = \\$1 million / .05 = \\$20 million Warning: The Perpetuity with Growth formula assumes that the growth rate in aftertax cash flows will continue forever (in perpetuity) and that the discount rate is based on reasonable risk-free rates. The PWG method will deliver absurdly high terminal values if you use a standardized growth rate that is higher than the historical growth rate for the general economy or a discount rate based on historically low risk-free rates. In other words, your business cannot grow faster than the general economy forever or eventually it will represent 100% of the world's GNP. Likewise, abnormally low interest rates will eventually revert to historical means. Ignoring these caveats will result in absurdly high terminal values. The PWG method also does not work well for businesses with a high degree of operating leverage, since small changes in revenues can lead to explosive growth (or decline) in free cash flows, rather than the steady changes assumed by the PWG formula. How Do You Calculate a Terminal Value for a Business That Has Rapid Free Cash Flow Growth or Other Complications? How do you calculate a terminal value for a business with rapid revenue growth, high operating leverage, or continued heavy working capital and fixed asset investments? Quite simply, there is [no accurate way to calculate a value under these circumstances.]{.underline} You must run the UFCFF projections long enough to saturate your market until the growth in free cash flows begins to approximate the growth of the overall economy. Choosing Between Terminal Value Methods How do you choose between methods? Entrepreneurs tend to use the [EBITDA Multiple method with low multiples when buying]{.underline} (because the terminal value will be conservative) and the [Perpetuity with Growth method with high growth rates and low discount rates when selling]{.underline} (because the terminal value will be aggressive). Academics seem to prefer the more complex Perpetuity with Growth method. The most important thing to remember is that all terminal value methods rely on uncertain projections made far into the future, and so any terminal value is little more than an educated guess. Discounting a Terminal Value as Part of Calculating Intrinsic Firm Value The whole purpose of estimating a terminal value is to use it to determine your Intrinsic Firm Value, the value of your estimated future free cash flows to you. This means that you must add this figure to the final year's annual unlevered Free Cash Flow to the Firm (uFCFF) and discount all of the annual cash flows back to the present. It also is important to decide whether or not you need to deduct taxes from the terminal value in the final year. With the PWG method, you are extrapolating the value of the after-tax free cash flows, so there is no need to deduct taxes as if the company was sold in the final year. Likewise with the EBITDA method, where you are selling the company in the final year, any taxes will be paid by individual shareholders and not the company, so taxes do not need to be deducted from the company's free cash flows to the firm. {width=\"6.5in\" height=\"2.4305555555555554in\"} The only time taxes need to be deducted from a terminal value is if it is assumed that the firm's assets will be liquidated and taxes are paid on any gains. Summary As the owner of a business, you are entitled to its free cash flows in perpetuity. So while your ability to accurately project free cash flows diminishes with time, you do want to receive value in a harvest for the cash flows beyond the terminal years of your projections. Terminal values provide a way to capture the value of free cash flows that occur beyond the final year of your projections, so you can add this value to the final year of your Unlevered Free Cash Flow to the Firm projections to determine the Intrinsic Firm Value today. Use the EBITDA Multiple method or the Perpetuity with Growth methods to estimate a Terminal Value only if the free cash flow in the Terminal Year has slowed to at or below the growth rate of the overall economy. You cannot use the PWG or the EBITDA methods for a business with rapid revenue growth, operating leverage, or heavy working capital and capital expenditure investments. Above all, never forget that however you arrive at a terminal value, it is at best an imprecise and imperfect look into the future. Those who buy businesses based on large terminal values that lie far into the future are, by definition, making a risky bet on events far beyond their vision or control.

How long would you expect it to take for this company to turn cash flow positive? Unfortunately, you cannot answer this question without understanding the working capital requirements. If the business, as in the following example, is steadily increasing sales, must pay its suppliers cash on delivery, gives its customers 120 days to pay debts, and keeps 30 days of inventory on hand, it will not be until the third year that the business will turn cash flow positive. [If you do not understand how working capital affects free cash flows, you can find yourself running a very profitable business that runs out of cash and dies.]{.underline} Components of Working Capital Accounts Receivable Accounts receivable is credit extended to a customer so he or she can take delivery of a product today and pay later. For a lemonade stand, this is the money owed to you by your big brother and his friends because they bought lemonade on credit, promising to pay you in seven days when they get their allowance. While waiting for your brother and his friends to pay, your lemonade stand may show a profit but be losing cash. You want to keep your accounts receivable days as short as possible, because you need the cash coming in the door from customers to pay workers, suppliers, banks, taxes, etc. To calculate accounts receivable, you first determine what terms you will offer your customers (30-day terms would mean that they can take the lemonade now, provided they pay you within thirty days). Next, you determine how much you are selling per day (i.e. sales / days in period). Last, you multiply the sales per day by the payment terms you have given your customers: Accounts Receivable = (Total Revenue / Days in Period) x Days Receivable So if you earned \\$1,000,000 in revenue for the year, and had 30-day payment terms with your customers, your accounts receivable would be: (1,000,000 / 365) x 30 = \\$82,192 There is a delicate balance in managing accounts receivable that can be obscured by gross generalizations like the calculations above. On one hand, you do not want to tie up valuable cash by extending credit to customers who don't demand it; and you especially want to avoid extending credit to deadbeat customers who later will refuse to pay. On the other hand, there may be some customers who will pay a far higher price per unit, and buy in large volumes, if only you will extend credit for a short period of time. For these reasons, you cannot afford to look at accounts receivable simply as a line item on a balance sheet. Rather, it should be viewed as a customer-by-customer investment that must be weighed individually, based on the long-term value of a particular customer relationship. Inventory Inventory describes the stocks of raw materials, work in process, and finished goods you must keep on hand to maintain a smooth flow of salable goods for your customers. Inventory is an inherently forward-looking calculation (how much lemonade do I need on hand to serve all of my customers today?). As such, projected inventory should be based on the amount of product you anticipate selling in the upcoming period. Inventory = (Inventory Days x COGS) / 365. So, if your COGS for next year is projected to be \\$4,000,000, and you want 15 days of inventory on hand, your inventory at the end of this year is: (\\$4,000,000 / 365) x 15 = \\$164,384 In general, the less inventory a business needs, the better. Inventory ties up valuable cash. It can also spoil, go obsolete or become lost, damaged or stolen while waiting to be purchased. Unfortunately, here too, there is a delicate balance. If you scrimp too much on inventory, shortages may occur at different places in your assembly line, leading to a less efficient use of manufacturing assets. Likewise, a lack of finished goods inventory may lead to stock outs of popular items and cause impatient customers to go elsewhere. Accounts Payable Accounts payable describes the credit extended to you by suppliers. In a way, accounts receivable is the reverse of accounts payable, because now you are the one who can buy today and pay tomorrow. Another way to think about accounts payable is that it describes the portion of your inventory that suppliers are willing to finance, in return for you agreeing to be their customer. Businesses like to have payable days as large as possible, as that means they are essentially getting a short-term, interest-free loan from their vendors. To calculate accounts payable, you would use a formula very similar to the accounts receivable calculation, but instead of calculating sales per day, you calculate COGS per day: Accounts Payable = (Total Cost of Goods Sold / Days in Period) x Payable Days2 If the COGS for the year were \\$500,000 and you had 30-day payment terms with your suppliers, your accounts payable would be: (500,000 / 365) x 30 = \\$41,096 Here too, there is a balancing act. You want to stretch your credit with suppliers as far as possible, but not so far that they start to demand higher prices or offer inferior service. Like accounts receivable, accounts payable should not be considered simply another line on the balance sheet, but rather a series of supplier-by-supplier negotiations, where the amount of credit demanded depends on the service required and amount of leverage you have with the individual supplier. Example 1: How Working Capital Can Make Life Harder The company described earlier is a young manufacturing firm. Because it has no credit history, its suppliers demand cash payments. The market is already quite crowded, so to attract customers, it must offer 120-day payment terms. To further sweeten the deal for new customers, the firm has guaranteed product availability, which in this case means it must keep 30 days of inventory on hand. The company is profitable from Day 1 but, because of the working capital requirements, it is cash flow negative for the first two years. Example 2: How Working Capital Can Make Life Easier The second company we will look at is in a very different situation. This is Acme-Mart, the largest discount retailer in the world. All of its customers pay in cash. Because it is so large and powerful in comparison to any one vendor, it can command 120-day payment terms from its suppliers. It also has very rigid delivery timelines with its suppliers and so only has to keep five days of inventory on hand (all numbers are in tens of billions). Conclusion Working capital is every bit as real an investment as the purchase of a building or an assembly line machine. The amount of working capital your business will need will depend on the length and complexity of your assembly line or service delivery process, the amount of credit your customers demand, and the willingness of suppliers to extend credit. Working capital is not simply a series of lines on a balance sheet, but a reflection of trade-offs made in the production process and selection of customers and vendors. As your business grows, its margins narrow, and your needs for working capital intensify, your ability to anticipate and manage working capital will have a growing impact on your subsequent free cash flows.

When is borrowing money for your business a good idea? When is it dangerous? These questions may seem simple, but many entrepreneurs get into trouble precisely because they fail to ask the most fundamental questions about borrowing money. The nature of some entrepreneurs is to pursue growth at all costs, borrowing as much as possible; others are so risk averse that they refuse to even consider debt, even when it would substantially lower their cost of capital. You need to grasp the basics of debt, or you risk that your company's debt levels will be determined by your personal feelings about money, rather than what's right for the business. The right approach is to consider external financing as just another asset---you can either \"rent\" money by borrowing it or \"buy\" it by selling some of your equity. The right amount of debt for your company will depend on whether or not the profits from additional growth exceed the costs, risks, and loss of control that come from promising fixed payments of interests and principal to debtors. This note describes the basics of debt, its advantages, disadvantages, and dangers so you can decide how much debt, if any, is right for your company. What is Debt? Debt is money advanced by a third party (a lender) in return for a promise by the borrower to pay rent (interest) for the use of the funds and repay the amount loaned (principal). The loan repayment usually occurs in a single payment or a series of set payments, either on a set date or on a series of dates. In other words, a lender says to you, \"You can use my money as long as you pay me 'rent' for the privilege of using it and agree to return it when you are finished.\" Debt can be thought of as being just like any other asset rented by a business. Borrowing a pile of cash is comparable to signing a lease on an office building. Interest, calculated as a percentage of the unpaid debt,2 is the rent you pay to use someone else's money One final issue: Typically debtors have priority over the equity rights of owners, which means debtors get paid first and the owners of a business (the equity holders) get paid only after all obligations to debtors have been satisfied. The Advantages of Debt There are five main reasons to use debt when financing a business: 1. You need to provide funds for working capital or fixed assets for a rapidly growing business that cannot be financed from its own internal free cash flows but does have assets (like inventory and accounts receivable) that can easily be resold 2. Debt is cheaper than equity. 3. Interest payments are subsidized by the federal government. 4. The financial leverage of a loan disproportionately increases returns if your business is 5. Nonrecourse debt creates option value. The Dangers of Debt Many of the advantages of debt for a business that does well become disadvantages---sometimes even fatal mistakes---if a business stumbles or muddles. 1. Compulsory principal and interest payments increase fixed-period costs and require higher sales to reach breakeven cash flows. 2. Even low interest rates can consume most of the profits of a low-margin, capital- intensive business or a business that muddles. 3. The first rights to cash flow and covenants (\"thou shall nots\") required by debt holders can reduce flexibility Summary All too often, an entrepreneur's appetite for debt is based more on personality traits than cold, hard analysis. Some entrepreneurs will borrow as much money as possible to finance skyrocketing growth, only to later lose their companies because the high interest expenses eliminated profit margins, resulting in the inability of free cash flows to service the debt. Conversely, other entrepreneurs are so risk averse that they refuse to even consider debt, even when it would substantially lower their cost of capital. The decision of whether to take on debt is the same as the decision to acquire any asset in a business. Do your projections of free cash flows suggest that the profits from additional growth and lowering the costs of financing (including the benefits of tax-deductible interest payments) exceed the costs and risks from higher fixed-period costs and a loss of operating control and flexibility? If so, consider debt. If not, avoid it. [Basis for priority]{.underline}: During normal operations : a. Royalties or commissions generally come \"off the top\" and are paid first, even if the business is operating at a loss. b. Next, operating expenses and taxes are paid. c. Then debt holders have a right to specified payments of interest and principal repayment. d. Finally, equity holders (owners) have the right to all remaining cash flows after royalties and commissions, operating expenses, taxes, and debt have been paid. e. Hybrid securities may have characteristics of both debt and equity and can include an option to convert debt-like rights to equity-like rights, depending on the performance of the business. {width=\"6.25in\" height=\"0.9604166666666667in\"} In bankruptcy : f. Holders of senior secured debt may seize assets that have been pledged as security and sell them to satisfy claims. g. If any value remains, holders of senior debt are then paid. h. Unsecured creditors are next in line to be paid, in descending order of priority as defined by loan agreements. i. Preferred shareholders are paid only if there is value left over after unsecured creditors have been paid. j. Common shareholders are paid only after everyone else has been satisfied. {width=\"6.25in\" height=\"3.36875in\"} [Debt Holders]{.underline} : Holders of senior secured debt have a mortgage on certain assets and > may seize these assets, sell them, and take as much cash as > necessary to satisfy their claims.

Those holding senior unsecured debt have the first right to excess > proceeds from the sale of secured assets and the proceeds from the > sale of unsecured assets. The claims of subordinated debt are explicitly placed behind those > of more senior classes of debt [Equity Holders]{.underline}: Preferred stockholders have the right to receive a stated stream of dividend payments before common shareholders receive any dividends. In a bankruptcy, preferred stockholders are paid before common stockholders. Common stockholders are paid last but have the right to all the cash that is left over after all prior claims are paid. Warrant and option holders have the right, but not the obligation, to buy a defined number of shares of common stock at a set price. These rights are not likely to be exercised unless the stock is trading above the set exercise price Schedule of priority: Create amortization tables Estimate the Free Cash Flow to the Firm Under Various Scenarios Calculate Payments Available for Debt and Equity Holders in Each > Scenario Show Returns to Debt and Equity by Class Calculating an Expected Value assign a probability for each > scenario, calculate NPV The key to unraveling priority is to clearly understand where each investor stands by asking questions such as: During normal operations, how are free cash flows shared? Are distributions at the discretion of management or are they mandatory? Is each payment defined as a share of sales, a percentage of profits, or a set amount of interest or principal? If there isn't enough cash to satisfy all obligations, who stands at the front of the line?

Ask insightful and probing questions. Run experiments to test the actual buying behavior of a customer. These techniques can help you predict prices, unit volume, the length of the sales cycle, the timing and magnitude of revenue, and the cost of generating sales. Too many would-be entrepreneurs believe, \\\"If I build it, they will come.\\\" Following this self-centered strategy yields a high probability of pouring lots of money into a dark hole. A master entrepreneur takes every opportunity to observe the buying habits of potential customers and tries to form hypotheses about their motives. This leads to questions that help you dig more deeply into the emotions and habits that drive buying behavior. Even carefully crafted and deeply probing questions have their limits. Some customers refuse to tell you the truth. Others change their minds. Many cannot articulate why they buy what they do. The best way to get inside a customer\\'s shoes is to design experiments that help you predict buyer behavior before you sink large amounts of money into irretrievable investments such as factories or direct sales forces. Observe. Draw conclusions. Question. Refine your theories. Run experiments. Do more of what works. Do all of these before you make large commitments of time and money. At its essence, this is what bootstrapping entrepreneurship is all about: adding value, one customer at a time.

[]{#_Toc9463691 .anchor}[Targeting the Right Customers]{.underline} When we talk about \"targeting,\" we're still talking about grouping customers, but as a trial and error\" process, using a customer-by-customer series of experiments carried out by the sales department, carefully observing how and why customers buy, and creating provisional segmenting categories. The ability to target the most attractive customers first, while efficiently expanding production capacity at the lowest risk possible, is one of the most important skills for any entrepreneur. There is little \"science\" to targeting. Rather, it is an art. You must observe and unearth needs, perform small experiments, and use these to correlate observable traits with unobservable internal needs, so that your business can focus on delivering exactly what your customers want, when they want it, and at a price and cost that allows you to make a healthy profit. Tips for Collecting, Organizing, and Displaying Customer Data There is no magic formula for targeting and satisfying customers. In a competitive marketplace, companies are constantly looking for ways to identify and satisfy discrete groups of customers in ways that are difficult to copy. Finding such a strategy is a mixture of art and luck, often obvious only in hindsight. Tip One: Identify Customer Needs Asking Potential Customers Observing Buyer Behavior Observing Usage Patterns Tip Two: Match Customer Needs to Observable Attributes Tip Three: How Price, Location, and Messaging Affect Revenues per Segment Tip Four: Identify the Most Profitable Customers (in the short run) Tip Five: Identify the Most Profitable Customers (in the long run) Customer Lifetime Value Evangelizing Customers Mapping Competitors and Substitutes []{#_Toc9463692 .anchor}[9. Pricing Strategies & The Seasons of Entrepreneurship]{.underline} Season One: Startup In startup season, just remaining in business is Priority One. What does that mean? It means focusing on every single customer and every single unit sold. It's simple: You need revenue and you need it now---you've got fixed-period costs (FPC) like rent and payroll to cover. And in order to cover those costs effectively, you've got to get the price right. Ask yourself, \"Am I attracting an inferior group of customers who are trained to ask for discounts?\" And, \"How will discounts like these affect contribution to my fixed-period costs and my progress toward breakeven?\" Having to say \"no\" to any sale this early is---obviously---tough. But it's necessary. And think about this, too: How's the temptation to discount a symptom of a larger problem? Is the real problem that you haven't found customers who are willing to pay for the value you provide? If so, that needs to be addressed now, before you go any farther. {width=\"6.5in\" height=\"1.94375in\"} Season Two: Shifting Focus to the Segments That Make a Market Now your pricing strategy must shift its focus from individual units and customers to segments: groups of customers who share common characteristics. Pricing is no longer a matter of your judgment on a case-by-case basis---you need more standardized policies that others can execute. Decision time: When you've divided customers into segments, which segment should you commit your pricing strategy? The one that will pay the most? The one that will buy the most? Both? Skim or penetrate? During startup, you priced high to reach breakeven quickly (or, in a less likely and more risky scenario, you priced low to attract lots of early customers to cover high fixed-period costs). But now it's time to decide what your pricing strategy will look like long term. Do you price high to skim the customer segments who place the highest value on your product, or do you price low to penetrate, to capture as much of the market as possible? Let's stick with the water example to illustrate. {width=\"3.597014435695538in\" height=\"2.079907042869641in\"} [Pricing High (Skimming)]{.underline} By pricing high, you'd capture most of the value in serving a single glass of water to the dying millionaire, but the price is far above the value (maximum benefit) perceived by the other segments, so you'll only sell one glass. [Pricing Low (Penetrating)]{.underline} By pricing low, you'll need to sell as many units as possible across all the segments. But pricing low means giving the customers in segments A, B, and C a disproportionately large amount of the value added. {width=\"6.5in\" height=\"2.6180555555555554in\"} Why not just charge different segments different prices? Charging different customers different prices is easier if you are the only salesperson, making snap judgments about each customer. It becomes complicated and difficult to execute when you try to codify this judgment to pass along to salesman and other employees. An important tradeoff this season: early payout or long-term profits? Season two is about making strategic decisions, one segment at a time. But reaching these segments---to advertise and educate them about the benefits of your product---often requires expensive investments in marketing and direct-sales forces, which in turn means charging higher prices to fund these efforts. But, at the same time, you want to keep prices low to encourage more early trial. But, without massive volume, pricing low might not give you the cash you need to encourage early trial to begin with. But pricing low and spending a great deal on marketing means risking large amounts of money to fund losses on a product that may never sell enough units to reach breakeven or payout. Likewise, pricing high and not investing in sales and marketing may lead to failure because uneducated customers are unwilling to pay a high price for unknown benefits [The bottom line? As you segment and price, be sure to account for the time and money it'll take to reach those segments.]{.underline} {width=\"6.5in\" height=\"1.9972222222222222in\"} So, price aside, how should you go about segmenting? You could approach segmenting in two different ways: 1) by focusing your portfolio of products and services and how they satisfy customers in various ways, or 2) by targeting the customer buying experience [Segmenting by Products and Services]{.underline} Customer needs usually fall into the following categories. Ask yourself how your product or services stacks up in each: Performance. How well does your product or service deliver on particular promises in ways that can be measured? Image. How does it change the way customers feel about themselves? Risk. Does the buyer face any risk by purchasing your product? If so, how can this be lowered or eliminated? Simplicity. Is your product easy to understand? Convenience and availability. Is it easy to find and buy? [The Customer Buying Experience]{.underline} Another way to segment is through the way a customer buys and uses the product and service. For example, your customer's experience with your product is likely to include the following steps: Research, costing, pricing, and planning a purchase Purchasing/ordering Delivery Use Billing Post-sale services No matter how well you segment your customers, soon competitors will begin to court those at the margins, those who don't quite \"fit.\" The next section describes how to adapt your products and strategies when---and hopefully before---competitors come knocking. Season Three: Maturity and Beyond It's no longer about the unit-by-unit, customer-by-customer focus of startup. And it's no longer just about segmenting. You're now at a precarious juncture when it comes to pricing. With competitors and substitutes in the mix, your products or services will begin to feel the magnetic tug toward commoditization---despite how good and unique you think your products portfolio is. You could begin discounting to regain or maintain customers who are beginning to look elsewhere. But you faced a similar dilemma about discounting during startup, didn't you? It's time to take action. And that means revisiting your pricing and segmenting strategies. The risk of marginal pricing There are at least three ways to resist commoditization and having to price low, almost all of which require re-segmenting customers and products and ranking them based on profitability. [Rank customers based on profitability]{.underline} You can calculate the profitability of each customer, or even each order, if you look for situations where you are delivering a high benefit for a low price. Either raise prices on these already high-profit customers or target more of them. And most importantly, \"fire\" the low profitability customers to make way for more profitable customers. This way you won't have to add capacity. Refocus your sales on these more desirable customers: get close to them, build and renew trust, provide them with more and more complex and important offerings. [Rank products and orders based on profitability]{.underline} You can also look more closely at the buying process. Which of your products is providing the most customer value, and where in its purchase cycle is the value the highest? Once identified, improve upon those best products and perfect the stages of the buying process that carry the most value. Bring up to speed the stages that bring the lowest value. And always try to move to deliver more for less Remember: Pricing is not a matter of deciding what amount you want to demand for a product or service, but a matter of creating and sharing value with customers. You want to constantly look for ways to create more value, not quibble over negotiating for a smaller and smaller share of a shrinking value pie. [Rank channels based on profitability]{.underline} Which channels are bringing the most profit and growth? Rank your most profitable with your least---like you did with customer segments---and focus on expanding the most profitable ones. Watch out: If increasing sales are coming from a low-margin channel like Walmart, soon average profits as a percentage of revenues will start to decline {width=\"6.5in\" height=\"2.066666666666667in\"} Summary Your pricing strategy changes throughout the entrepreneurial seasons. In the startup season, pricing is a matter of talking customer by customer and measuring unit by unit the contribution that is made toward fixed-period costs, all in a frantic effort to reach breakeven. If you reach breakeven, the role of pricing changes. Now you have gathered enough data on different customer segments to decide which segments to pursue and in what order. Your goals shift from mere survival to accelerating payout and maximizing profits (which often are in conflict) and you now group individual customers into segments, so you can develop standardized processes and routines to serve them more efficiently. These processes and routines---built segment by segment through trial and error---will become the source of your competitive advantage: your differentiation. In the final season, you will face the entropy of success: Complacency. Too much complexity. Growing overhead. Once again it is time to refocus customer by customer, product by product, experience by experience to look for areas to add a great deal of value, for as little cost as possible. []{#_Toc9463693 .anchor}[The Art of Pricing Pt. 1]{.underline} What is a Price? A price is really just a proxy, a number used to state one person's subjective value of an object or service, stated in a currency, like dollars and cents. Most entrepreneurs think of price in one of three ways: Cost-plus based pricing takes the cost in time and materials to make and deliver a product and then adds a cushion of profit. The profit added may be a fixed amount or it may vary as a percentage of cost. Cost-plus pricing has the benefit of being relatively simple: It's fairly easy to calculate the cost of a product and add a margin of profit. The drawback to cost-plus pricing is that it doesn't consider the value added for customers, meaning you could be pricing far lower than necessary, and leaving substantial profits on the table. Value-based pricing focuses on the benefit perceived by customer. The advantage to value-based pricing is that it attempts to capture some or most of the value you create. The drawback is that it requires you to \"put yourself in a customer's shoes\" to discover how much value a customer places on your product or service. Since this is a subjective and ever-changing number, it is difficult to estimate for even one customer, much less a heterogeneous collection of customers. Value-based pricing focuses on the benefit perceived by customer. The advantage to value-based pricing is that it attempts to capture some or most of the value you create. The drawback is that it requires you to \"put yourself in a customer's shoes\" to discover how much value a customer places on your product or service. Since this is a subjective and ever-changing number, it is difficult to estimate for even one customer, much less a heterogeneous collection of customers. Pricing in the Real World: Sharing the Value You Create with Customers So which of the three approaches to pricing is best? Actually, none of them in isolation, all of them in concert. Each approach---cost-plus pricing, value-based pricing, and competition-based pricing---has its merits, but each is only a static way to think about pricing. But pricing isn't a static concept. It's a dynamic conversation between entrepreneurs and consumers, a way of dividing the value created by trading, set amidst the competitive landscape of companies trying to steal each other's most marginal customers. Three important observations about prices: 1. Setting a price determines how a company and its customer share the value created in a transaction. 2. Advertising and education can increase the overall value of a transaction, allowing you to raise the price per unit. 3. Competitive pressures can force you to lower prices, even to a point that forces you into bankruptcy. What Is the \"Right\" Price? So price per unit can vary all the way between variable cost per unit (at least in the short run) and the maximum benefit offered to the customer, if the customer is fully aware of the benefit and has no other alternatives (substitutes). So where should you price in this continuum? Apart from any type of legal constraints or consideration of competitors' pricing, the decision largely depends on: [The type of product or service you are offering]{.underline} a. Impulse Needs (Impulse items are products or services a customer buys largely because \"they are there\" when the mood strikes. Think of a candy bar or a child's toy or a magazine sold at the checkout aisle of the supermarket).\\ b. Utilitarian or Functional Needs (These typically involve a need where the value can be rationally computed by the customer. Think of consumers calculating the benefit of buying a lawnmower and mowing the yard themselves versus paying a landscaping service). {width=\"6.5in\" height=\"3.1145833333333335in\"}c. Image or Complex Needs (These usually say something about the user's identity (for consumer goods) or involve solving complex problems for business customers). [2. Whether your strategy is to \"skim\" or \"penetrate\" a market]{.underline} Your financial and pricing strategy can often be simplified as a decision to skim and price as high as possible, or to penetrate and price low to capture a large share of a market quickly. Skimming means pricing high to skim the highest need customers, adding successive segments of increasingly lower-need customers to build volume. Penetrating means pricing low to attract as many customers as quickly as possible, so you can spread large fixed-period costs over as many units as possible. {width=\"6.5in\" height=\"1.68125in\"} Summary Many take prices for granted, seeing them simply as the amount of money you pay or receive for a product or service. But the savvy entrepreneur sees prices, and the art of pricing, as a far more complex dance, the creation and sharing of value between company and customer, performed in the presence of competitors who are trying to steal customers. One of the miracles of the free market is that, in the absence of fraud or coercion, no sale ever takes place between a buyer and seller that doesn't add value for both. Price is simply the result of an agreement of how the rewards will be shared between the parties. No matter what type of product and service you choose to make and deliver, or whether you plan to skim or penetrate a market, pricing will remain an art---subject to trial and error, practice and mastery---more than a science of market studies and calculation. Practicing this art, and continuing to look for new ways to add value to customers, while avoiding the ruinous price wars that come from competing on price alone, almost certainly may add to your profits, and just may save your business. []{#_Toc9463694 .anchor}[The Art of Pricing Pt. 2]{.underline} {width=\"6.5in\" height=\"2.6902777777777778in\"} Start with Supply The danger of this \"build it and they will come\" approach is that it often encourages people to build businesses that never attract customers. Time and again we find entrepreneurs who make large sunk investments, certain that customers will want their product, only to find that a market never existed. Starting with the Customer How you have chosen your customer, your primary sunk investment, and the \"units\" you produce and deliver, will be the difference between success and failure. Unit Economics is a framework to help you make the very best choices possible. An entrepreneur once defined profit as \"over-recovered\" fixed cost. In Unit Economics, you learn to correctly define the sunk investments and fixed costs your venture will require. Then you will see if you are likely to attract enough customers who will buy enough \"units\" at a high enough price to make the investment worthwhile. And you will learn to do all of this before you make the sunk investment. Bridging the Gap Between Demand and Supply An entrepreneur matches a set of needs with the specifications for a product that satisfies that need. The glue that holds these two \"units\" together is the benefit you offer to the customer when using your product---a product that must be better, faster, or cheaper than any other way of satisfying that need. The combination of the \"unit of desire\" inside the customer, the \"unit of production\" given to the shop foreman, and the benefit the customer gets from using the product, successfully bridges the gap and forms the foundation of your business. This is the framework of unit economics. Demand: Customers, Prices, and Volumes You always start with a customer need and what the customer is willing to pay to satisfy it. But this answer is too simple. You cannot survey every customer, ask them what they want, and customize a solution. The cost of discovery and customization is too great. You need to find a group of customers with relatively homogeneous needs. [How do you determine a price?]{.underline} Quantify the maximum value your customer places on your product . This is the highest possible price you could charge (because no one would buy it after that). Measure your costs per unit. (Costs can vary depending on volume, but we'll get to that later. For now, choose a volume and measure cost per unit at that volume). The difference between the max value and the cost per unit is the \"shared value,\" because it's the total value of the product that must get divided up between you and the customer. Decide how much of the shared value you want to keep to yourself and how much you will give to the customer. Your price will be based on how much value you want to keep and concede. All of this works beautifully, until one little problem arises: a competing product or substitute of the same value starts selling for less. With no apparent difference in the value received by the customer, no customer will pay more for your product. So your new ceiling price is the price of the substitute. Decide again how much shared value you want to offer the customer and how much you want to keep, and you've determined your new price. {width=\"5.658536745406824in\" height=\"3.5287248468941383in\"} Value But how does a customer decide on the value of a product? Value is judged in the mind of an individual. The maximum price a customer will pay is set inside the mind of each consumer as they make subjective and sometimes irrational tradeoffs between the money they have, the intensity of the desires they wish to satisfy, {width=\"6.5in\" height=\"3.2729166666666667in\"} The Mistake of Using Costs to Set Prices Many people use a \"cost-plus\" approach to pricing because it is easier to calculate the costs of production than to crawl inside the heads of your customers to measure their whims. That is why this note started with you stumbling onto an empty pipeline, and why so many people take a \"build it and hope they will come\" approach. But setting prices based on costs is a mistake. If costs lead you to price below what your customers are willing to pay, you may give away too much value to the customer. If costs lead you to price above what your customers are willing to pay, you will not sell a single unit, and all of your costs will truly be \"sunk.\" Basing prices on costs can cause you to miss a lucrative opportunity. What is a Primary Sunk Investment? A primary sunk investment is: \u2022 The most important investment a company makes to satisfy its chosen set of customers. \u2022 Either the largest investment the company makes or the asset that would be the most expensive to duplicate. \u2022 A process or asset that allows a company to do the most important tasks again and again in the most efficient way possible to deliver exactly what the customer will pay for. \u2022 The single most important investment to: (1) invent a new product or create a new product; (2) attract customers; (3) manufacture a product; or (4) deliver a product. 15 It typically serves every customer in the same way. {width=\"6.5in\" height=\"4.685416666666667in\"} Summary Unit economics is about making sunk investments---primary sunk investments---where you are confident you can \"over-recover\" the investment to make a profit. When you start your business, it is critical to have defined your primary sunk investment, and the \"units\" its standardized process is designed to deliver. You must understand that the key attributes of these \"units of production\" are critical for satisfying the \"units of desire\" in your subset of customers, how many of these customers are likely to buy and what price they will pay. You then can calculate the variable and fixed period costs required to attract, make, and deliver these units, and how long it will take to recover your primary sunk investment and other start-up costs. All of business---from water pipelines to theme parks---is a matter of making and recovering sunk investments in a standardized set of processes. If you are clear about the \"units\" you are selling, and the primary sunk investment you have made, the chances are much higher that you will \"over recover\" your fixed and sunk costs and survive.

Gauge the quality of prospects you attract, quantify the cost of each step of the sales process and note the number of potential customers who drop out at every step, so it becomes clear where you need to focus your efforts to improve your sales process. Sales Funnel's vs. Production Lines Assembly lines are about doing the right thing. Sales funnels are about asking the right questions, offering the right choices, watching what customers do, and praying they decide to buy in the end. 1 Just How Difficult is it to Predict Customer Behavior? The actions of human beings are hard to predict and influence, but if you break down a sales process into discrete steps, pay close attention to why some prospects are more likely to close than others, and measure how many prospects defect at each step, you can begin to make the sales process more predictable. The Value of a Quick \"No\" The only thing better than a quick \"yes\" in sales is a quick \"no.\" A quick \"no\" from a disinterested prospect frees you up to search for a customer who truly needs what you are offering. The worst type of prospect is one that takes up an inordinate amount of your time and, only after a great deal of time, attention, and money has been spent, decides not to buy. {width=\"4.72619094488189in\" height=\"4.199543963254593in\"} Building a Sales Funnel The Major Questions for Sales Funnel Design: The design of your sales process will depend on whether your customers are: (1) easy or hard to find, (2) eager or reluctant to buy, and (3) worth a lot or a little to close. Customers who are easy to find, eager to buy, and valuable to close are an entrepreneur's dream. Customers who are difficult to find, hard to convince, and of little value to close are an entrepreneur's nightmare. It is with the \"in-between\" customers that the right sales process can make the difference between success and failure. The Major Decisions in Sales Funnel Design Do you want to grow quickly or slowly? Will your campaign be broad or targeted? Will you have an intense sales effort to convince prospects to buy, or a more restrained approach? Will you go to your customer, or have them come to you? Will you take all comers, or be selective about the customers you choose? What Is the Difference between a Lead, a Prospect, and a Qualified Prospect? Unfortunately, we cannot tell from outward appearance when a customer moves from being a lead---someone who is mildly curious---to being a prospect who is more likely to close. We can ask our customers questions, but they do not always answer truthfully and often change their minds. Staging Investments We need to test as many sales funnel alternatives as possible before committing to large upfront and fixed-period costs. Your initial estimates will likely be wrong. That is why it is important to stage, test, and carefully monitor the yield and costs at each step of the process. The longer your sales cycle and the faster you intend to grow, the more important it is to collect data early in the process so that you can adapt quickly Sizing the Funnel Once you've estimated how your sales cycle, the average costs per sale, and the capacity of the funnel varies for different sales funnel arrangements, you can compare your estimates of how quickly sales will increase to the overall size of the market. You'll want to size the sales funnel so that you attract customers quickly enough to discourage competitors from entering your niche, but recover all of your costs and make a healthy profit before you run out of prospects. Some Tips on the Sales Process It is generally much cheaper to sort and qualify customers who are interested in buying than to try to interest and persuade customers (changing minds is expensive). Each additional step in a sales funnel adds an exponential amount of complexity and cost. Communications and handoffs from one step in the process to another are expensive and difficult to execute. Targeted approaches tend to work better than broad approaches. Convincing customers to come to you is usually far more effective than having to go to them. Summary Designing and building a sales funnel is much more difficult than designing an assembly line. Using machines to cut and shape widgets is much easier than attracting, informing, sorting, and closing finicky potential customers. The difficulty involved makes it even more important to design a sales funnel that fits with the type of customer we want to attract and the benefits we offer. Each time we spend money to attract, sort, or convince customers, we must measure the number and quality of the prospects that move to the next step. That way, over time, we will learn to predict how to turn customers' needs into revenue as quickly as possible, at the lowest possible cost per sale, and to recover the costs of our sales funnel long before we run out of potential customers.

A Note Far too many mid-level managers and corporate executives spend far too much time with whitecollar marketers like themselves and far too little time on the salesroom floor with salespeople, carefully tracking leads as they move through the sales process to become customers and then repeat customers. The best companies pay special attention to improving their sales funnels, but even in these companies, the ability to build (or rebuild) a sales funnel from scratch is missing, perhaps because the existing funnel is taken for granted. That may be because sales funnels are built by founders initially, not in a deterministic way, but through careful trial and error, as the founding entrepreneur becomes too busy and has to begin standardizing and delegating tasks. At each step of building the sales funnel, an entrepreneur has to sell through trial and error by keenly observing the path that the most valuable customers take and by looking to improve the volume of sales and the quality of customers, while simultaneously lowering the average cost per sale. This process of constructing an increasingly effective and efficient sales funnel requires careful experimentation, a keen eye, intuitive leaps, and a fair helping of luck to identify the processes, skills, and judgment needed to make a particular sales funnel more effective. Despite the difficulty, building an efficient and effective sales funnel is well worth the effort. It is often the key []{#_Toc9463697 .anchor}A Sales Funnel or Word of Mouth (WOM)? A. To design and create a Sales Funnel---a series of steps to attract, qualify, educate, and close customers. B. To work hard to delight your first few customers, so that these early converts begin a Word of Mouth (WOM) movement that results in exploding revenues. A sales funnel sounds like a lot of work, but more scientific and predictable. A word of mouth approach sounds like more fun and potentially much more lucrative, but harder to predict. So which is better for your business? The short answer: It depends. {width=\"3.592600612423447in\" height=\"1.8690474628171478in\"} {width=\"4.013888888888889in\" height=\"2.6805555555555554in\"} The Benefits and Drawbacks of Sales Funnels and Word of Mouth Sales funnels ---when well built and implemented---provide a systematic approach to increasing revenues. Under the right conditions, every step of the process can be tested to see which messages and techniques increase close rates, add to customer satisfaction, or decrease costs. The drawbacks? They're expensive to design and operate and, when done poorly, may make customers feel more like widgets on a factory assembly line than highly valued individuals. And the only way to increase sales is to pump more and better leads into the start of the funnel. Sales funnels tend to work better for higher-priced functional products or simple image-based ones, where benefits can be explained and reluctant customers discarded at each step along the way. Word of Mouth (WOM) has the advantage of rapid, often exponential sales growth, at a very low cost. Plus, done properly, customers may begin to develop a deep sense of belonging, making it hard for competitors to lure them away. Word of mouth is easy to recognize and fun to talk about, but unfortunately it's very hard to execute deliberately. In practice, it's difficult to ignite the right spark and keep enthusiasm at consistently high levels from one generation of customers to the next, because the technique depends largely on the emotions of crowds and societal trends. Word of mouth sales also tend to work better for more complex \"image\" or \"identity\" products and services, or for faddish impulse items than for more mundane, functional products. How Do You Create and Execute a Successful Word of Mouth Campaign? Start with a product that involves image or identity element of image or belonging---they say something about who you are, and they describe deep, important issues that you want to share with your \"tribe.\" Create a message that's memorable and \"sticky\" so it spreads easily. a. It is simple \"Get it there.\" b. It surprises you; it is unexpected Tom's Shoes promises to donate a pair to a child in need. c. Concreteness Your senses are excited. Emotional words lead to something you can feel and touch d. Credibility There are powerful testimonials from people who do not have any conflicts of interest. e. Emotions You are touched deeply, often with a positive feeling like hope or gratitude f. Story There is a simple, powerful, often redemptive, story Delight all your customers---capture, affirm, and arm the evangelical ones g. Connectors know lots of people and enjoy bringing them together in constructive ways h. Mavens are experts. They specialize in collecting and sharing information i. Salespeople are persuaders. They convince people to take risks, to try something j. they wouldn't ordinarily try Keep the conversation going -- make them feel valued part of a new movement and an important part of enlisting others in the cause k. Once a customer engages, ask him or her for advice, and show that you take their ideas seriously and that you put those ideas to work. l. Ask them to test and provide feedback on new products. m. Even ask for suggestions for new products to introduce Provide incentives, but be careful not to try to purchase loyalty. Have strong \"we believe\" statements. Measure the right markers n. Track what percentage of your customers says \"yes\" to the question, \"Would you recommend this product or service to a friend?\" o. Measure how many new customers come from referrals. p. Count the number of new product ideas submitted by customers. The right timing helps---a lot. Great stories and deep emotions are timeless. But context helps immensely too No matter how exactly you plan to execute, keep these basic principles from Seth Godin in mind. a. Transparency. Your customers aren't stupid. If they think for a second that you're being inauthentic about your passion for your product or service (and why should you be, really?), they'll bolt. b. A movement bigger than you. How does your product or service help change the world in a significant way? c. Movements that grow, thrive. WOM is about more that short-term tactics. How is today part of a growing, dynamic tomorrow? d. Exclude outsiders. How well have you chosen your customers and followers so that you don't expend wasted effort elsewhere? So Which Is Better---a Sales Funnel or a Word of Mouth Campaign? So which is it? The truth is---you need them both. {width=\"6.5in\" height=\"2.071527777777778in\"} WOM campaigns sound exciting, but they're usually too unreliable and unpredictable of a technique on which to bet your future. That means that once you find the right customer niche, you need a well-designed sales funnel: a repeatable, scalable process that gives you a higher probability of surviving startup and the early years of the launch phase. But if you have the right products, and sense the spark of delighted customers who want to tell their friends, it'd be foolish not to try to fan these sparks into a WOM wildfire that could turn your best customers not only into a free sales force, but into a tribe that no competitor could lead astray. +-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+ | | Sales Funnel | Word of Mouth | +=======================+=======================+=======================+ | Definition | The sales funnel | - viral marketing | | | breaks the sales | | | | process into the | - product or brand | | | discrete steps | evangelists---spr | | | required to attract, | ead | | | educate, qualify, and | the word to new | | | close customers | customers | | | | | | | | - Every step of the | | | | sales funnel | | | | still occurs but | | | | now customers are | | | | performing these | | | | tasks (usually) | | | | for free, as they | | | | spread the word | | | | to friends and | | | | family and | | | | convince them to | | | | buy | +-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+ | Benefits | - When well-built | - rapid, often | | | and | exponential sales | | | implemented---pro | growth, at a very | | | vide | low cost | | | a systematic | | | | approach to | - done properly, | | | increasing | customers may | | | Revenues | begin to develop | | | | a deep sense of | | | - every step of the | belonging, making | | | process can be | it hard for | | | tested to see | competitors to | | | which messages | lure them away | | | and techniques | | | | increase close | - tend to work | | | rates, add to | better for more | | | customer | complex \"image\" | | | satisfaction, or | or \"identity\" | | | decrease costs | products and | | | | services, or for | | | - work better for | faddish impulse | | | higher-priced | items than for | | | functional | more mundane, | | | products or | functional | | | simple | products | | | image-based ones | | +-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+ | Drawbacks | - expensive to | - very hard to | | | design and | execute | | | operate | deliberately | | | | | | | - when done poorly, | - difficult to | | | may make | ignite the right | | | customers feel | spark and keep | | | more like widgets | enthusiasm at | | | on a factory | consistently high | | | assembly line | levels from one | | | than highly | generation of | | | valued | customers to the | | | individuals | next, because the | | | | technique depends | | | | largely on the | | | | emotions of | | | | crowds and | | | | societal trends | | | | | | | | - usually too | | | | unreliable and | | | | unpredictable of | | | | a | | | | | | | | - technique on | | | | which to bet your | | | | future | +-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+ | Sales process | \"Attract-Educate-Qual | \"Attract-Educate-Qual | | | ify-Close,\" | ify- | | | | | | | | Close-Connect-Affirm- | | | | Arm\" | +-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+ To spark powerful WOM: An amazing and useful product or service Fierce passion for that product or service and for letting those who can benefit from it know about it.

Answering a Question with a Question is an ongoing process. Don't just ask a question for the sake of asking a question; use the information you gather from your prospect's answers to inform your next questions. 2. Never answer an unasked question. Sometimes what sounds like a question is actually just a statement. Don't make assumptions. Don't answer what you think your prospect is asking---they could be confused or thinking aloud. Ask for clarification. For example, \"The price is too high\" is not a question. You could respond with, \"Does that mean that...?\" in order to get the prospect to nail down their precise problem. 3. If a prospect asks the same question twice, answer it. If you continue asking questions, you'll set the wrong tone for the meeting. The prospect will think you're being coy or playing games.","title":"Tools: Customers &amp; Sales"},{"location":"acton/#tools-operations","text":"Intro to Operations & Costs The Goal Pt. 1 The Goal Pt. 2 Scheduling and Sequencing Pt. 1 Processes 101 Making Incremental Improvements Operations Midpoint Reflection Pt. 1 Operations Midpoint Reflection Pt. 2 Surveying the Battlefield Root Beer Simulation Making a Big Bet in Operations Incentives, Labor, and Human Variability Intro to Queuing Theory Making Tradeoffs in Operations Scheduling and Sequencing Pt. 2 Practical Statistics and Probability","title":"Tools: Operations"},{"location":"acton/#intro-to-operations-costs","text":"[The overarching question of the Operations & Costs course is:]{.underline} How do you build a production---or service---delivery process that delivers exactly the right product or service, in the right quantities, at the right time, with the lowest cost per unit and the smallest upfront investment possible?

To Increase throughput while simultaneously decreasing inventory and operating expenses. Throughput: the rate at which the system generates money through sales (the money coming in) Inventory: all the money invested in things it intends to sell (money in the system) Operating Expenses: the money spent to turn inventory into throughput (money you pay to make throughput happen) Five Focusing Steps for Continuous Improvement : Find the bottleneck. Get more from the bottleneck's current resources. Redirect existing resources towards the bottleneck, don't produce more than it can or you'll build up inventory. Increase resources for the bottleneck ONLY once you've squeezed the most you can out of it. Find the new constraint and return to step 1, consider increasing resources to other areas to match the bottleneck's improvement. You could think you're running an efficient system, but your thinking might be wrong. If you didn't increase sales, throughput, or decrease costs, you didn't increase productivity . If you don't know what the real goal is, which you could very well be wrong about, then you can't figure out what to do to reach the goal. And the goal of any business is to make money . If you keep everyone and everything working at full capacity, you'll naturally build up inventory by creating excess work. A plant where everyone is working all the time is very inefficient. You can't have a \"balanced plant\" without doing excess work. Because of dependent events and statistical fluctuations , you'll naturally run into bottlenecks in the system, kind of like the fattest kid on a hike slowing everyone down. The whole system only moves as fast as the bottleneck , so it makes sense to focus on increasing the bottleneck's capacity and tying the rest of the system's rate to the rate of the bottleneck. In the analogy, put the fat kid at the front of the line, and make his backpack as light as possible so he can walk faster. Since output can only deviate up to the maximum level determined by its dependent events , but it can deviate down much lower, with successive dependent events you'll get further and further negative fluctuations. A kid can come to a halt, but he can only catch up as much as the kid in front of him, he can never catch up past the point the previous kid has already walked. Bottleneck: \"A bottleneck is any resource whose capacity is equal to or less than the demand placed upon it. And a non-bottleneck is any resource whose capacity is greater than the demand placed on it.\" [139] An easy way to find a bottleneck is to look and see what has a big pile of work in front of it [144] To optimize the system, make the flow through the bottleneck equal to the demand from the market . Or, a tiny bit less than the demand from the market. [139] In most cases you'll have capacity that is hidden from you because some of your thinking is incorrect . The first thing you should always do is see exactly how the bottlenecks are currently operating, and if you can change how they're used to increase their capacity (before simply hiring or buying more tools). [152] If you lose even one hour on the bottleneck, you have lost it forever. You can't get it back somewhere else in the system . Your throughput for the entire system will be lower by whatever amount the bottleneck produces in that time. [153] Lost time on the bottleneck is lost throughput which means you've lost the total output of the whole system . If your whole plant earns \\$1,000 an hour, then an hour lost on the bottleneck is \\$1,000 lost . Make sure it's time isn't wasted by: [157 / 159] Sitting idle and not getting used during some break For it to be spending time on output that's already defective Making it work on something you don't need You can increase the capacity of the bottleneck by: [159] Only making it work on what will increase throughput today Taking some of the load off the bottleneck and giving it to non-bottlenecks When you make a non-bottleneck do more work than the bottleneck, you create excess inventory and thus lose money. [210] What you have to do is figure out how to release materials at the start of the process exactly according to the capacity of the bottleneck . [216] If you reduce your batch size, you increase throughput by reducing inventory held and reducing the amount of cash tied up at any one time. It also lets you move faster, since the gaps will be smaller since the time to process a batch will be lowered as well, and your total lead time on any project condenses. [232] Three simple questions: What to change, what to change to, and how to cause the change. [337] Scheduling & Sequencing Pt. 1 Gantt Chart Basics A Gantt chart is a horizontal bar graph used to visualize the sequence and timing of tasks in a project or process.1 Gantt charts are a useful planning instrument before a project starts and can be used during a project to measure progress and make it easier for team members to communicate. {width=\"6.816735564304462in\" height=\"2.447761373578303in\"} Creating a Gantt chart is like creating a puzzle. How you solve it will depend on your goals and constraints. For example, you may need to finish a project as fast as possible. Or you might want to finish a project with limited resources before a deadline. Developing a Gantt chart helps you visualize and confront scheduling challenges associated with your project or process. As you work to define the tasks and sequence them, you may need to gather information or assistance from your project team or customer. Once a project is underway, your Gantt chart can serve as a reminder of the tasks that need to be completed each day (or hour or minute) and as a checkpoint to make sure each task is being completed on time. []{#_Toc9463701 .anchor}Processes 101 Processes Processes are important for entrepreneurs because dividing a more complex task into smaller steps enables the creation of value to be standardized---which allows an individual worker to specialize and learn to do an individual task better, cheaper, and faster over time. With each task in your process specialized, you can hire lower cost labor or even purchase a machine to automate the task. Once you have established the specifications demanded by customers to satisfy their needs and desires and have decided what range of customer need you will serve (which determines how wide a variability your process will serve), you can begin to experiment with how finely to divide tasks and how to order them. Creating a Process 1. Define the Customer Need 2. Designing: Choose which part of the process you will own 3. Designing: Chart the steps you will control 4. Execute your process in the real world 5. Continually improve Process Mapping Being able to describe, order, chart, and measure individual tasks and overall processes is a critical skill for entrepreneurs. That means learning, practicing with, and becoming fluent in the symbols and conventions of Process Flow Diagrams (or Process Maps), which allow you to describe and measure a process on paper---and share it with managers and others---before you try it for real. Here's a brief vocabulary lesson in the language of Process Flow Diagrams: A rectangle represents a single Task in the process. A task is completed at a workstation where energy or labor is used to transform a material or deliver a service. Usually there is a worker in charge of doing the work, sometimes with the aid of some equipment. Sometimes tasks are automated and do not require a worker. {width=\"1.9583333333333333in\" height=\"1.1527777777777777in\"} {width=\"5.694444444444445in\" height=\"1.1111111111111112in\"} {width=\"6.069444444444445in\" height=\"1.2083333333333333in\"} {width=\"6.5in\" height=\"1.8097222222222222in\"} 1. Raw Materials are inputs of material into the process. 2. Work in Process (WIP) means units of production that have been partially, but not completely, transformed from Raw Materials into Finished Goods and are temporarily stored in a queue awaiting the next step in the process. 3. Finished Goods (FGI) are final products that have been completely transformed by 8 the process and are ready for delivery to the customer. 3 Types of Processes Serial Process Parallel Process Batch Process {width=\"6.5in\" height=\"2.4680555555555554in\"} A Parallel Process is when the exact same task is done simultaneously by two or more workstations at the same time, to divide the flow into multiple streams. Parallel workstations make sense when it's not cheaper to use a larger machine. {width=\"5.0in\" height=\"3.1191240157480316in\"} A Batch Process means that a group of products are all acted on by a workstation at once, rather than one at a time. Process Metrics The most important measures of the performance of your operation are: \u2022 Reliability. How effective are you at making units that meet specification? \u2022 Flexibility. How much variability can your process handle? \u2022 Capacity. How many units can you produce in a given time period? \u2022 Lead-time. How long does it take for a customer's order to be filled? \u2022 Overall investment. How much money, including equipment, inventory, etc., is tied up in the line? [Some Definitions]{.underline} Capacity How many units (on average) could a given workstation transform in a period of time? Capacity is important because the overall process capacity will be constrained by the workstation with the lowest capacity. Output How many actual units did a given workstation actually transform in a period of time, given that the process didn't work exactly as expected? Actual output is important because it shows how well the workstation is performing in reality versus what it theoretically could produce. Process Time How long does it take to transform inputs into one unit of output at a given workstation? The process time of a task is important because the sum of all process times from start to finish, will determine how long a customer must wait before their product is delivered. Cycle Time How frequently are units completed at a particular process stage? For a workstation with two workers performing tasks in parallel, the cycle time will be 50 percent of what it would be with only one worker performing the task. In general, the equation for calculating cycle time for a workstation is: (Task process time per unit) / (# of Tasks in Parallel at Workstation) Cycle time is important for an entrepreneur to understand, because cycle time tells you for a given period of time how many units are being produced at this workstation. The cycle time for the process as a whole is the same as the cycle time of the individual component process (or processes) with the greatest cycle time -- also known as the \"bottleneck\" process. {width=\"6.5in\" height=\"3.10625in\"} Idle Time A workstation which does not have any work-in-process inventory available to be transformed is experiencing idle time. Idle time represents unused capacity at the workstation. Too much idle time at a workstation is a waste of resources. Depending on the needs of the overall process, you might seek to increase the availability of work-in-process inventory at the workstation so there is less idle time, or you may reassign the idle worker to perform another task. So when a workstation is experiencing idle time, it is operating at less than 100 percent capacity (this isn't necessarily a bad thing). A useful way to measure the productivity of a workstation is capacity utilization. To calculate the capacity utilization for a workstation for a given time period, simply divide the actual production output by the expected capacity. For example, if a workstation is capable of transforming 50 units per hour, but is only able to produce 30 units per hour due to idle time, then the capacity utilization for the workstation is: Capability Utilization = (Actual Output)/(Expected Capacity) = (30 units)/(50 units) = 0.60 = 60% Wait Time The amount of time that the unit being transformed has to wait in queue prior to entering the next workstation is referred to as wait time. Wait time is important to calculate because a unit waiting is a unit that is not being converted into money from sales. Lead-Time Lead-time is an important measure of your process. The simplest definition is that lead-time is the total elapsed time from when a request is made to when the request is filled. Process Balance A process is balanced when the capacities of each process stage are closely matched, resulting in a minimum of idle time for the workstations and a minimum amount of wait time for WIP inventory. However, once your line is up and running, balancing the capacities of each process stage is not a critical goal. Once your real-world line is running, you should focus on finding and eliminating bottlenecks. Bottlenecks: An Important Limiting Factor {width=\"6.5in\" height=\"1.3444444444444446in\"} Summary It's important as an entrepreneur to establish a clear goal for your operations to meet the specific requirements of a customer or defined group of customers. When you focus on a specific need and learn to say \"no\" to other distractions, you are better able to align all your processes to meet your customer's need better than your competitors. Mapping and measuring your process helps you to identify, specialize, delegate, and optimize each step. First, you must be able to design and implement a process that adds value for customers. This means giving customers something they want, reliably, and for a cost they will accept. The faster the rate (capacity) and quicker the speed (lead-time) that you can get the product into your customer's hands, the greater advantage you will have. Unlike a paper process map, a real-world process is dynamic and sometimes difficult to handle. The better you understand the components of your process, the more able you will be to adjust as real-world forces nibble at your assumptions. A process with flexibility will allow you over time to reconfigure the process and product to meet the ever-changing landscape of market forces. Operations is a never-ending quest to deliver the right product, at the right time, with the lowest cost per unit. 3 Business Model Archetypes Archetypes are only models and each has a different trade off between risk and reward. The attractiveness of any particular business depends not only on its model, but how well management executes, the reactions of the competition, and the general business context. Artisan Deliver highly customized products to customers who will pay for exactly what they want [Examples:]{.underline} portrait artist, tailor of handmade suits, tutor Job Shop S ome customers need a limited number of standardized products, too many units to be made by hand, but not enough units from any one customer to justify investments in expensive machinery. Job shops spread the costs of machinery over a larger number of units by combining customer orders and using production lines that can be reconfigured to produce small batches of different products. [Examples:]{.underline} small bakery producing a variety of items, machine shop producing batches of different electrical components, software programming company that customizes input screens while reusing a core set of code Mass Production Mass production facilities produce large quantities of standardized products (commodities) for customers who care more about price than customization. Long production runs spread fixed period costs and investments over a large number of units [Examples:]{.underline} a commodity chemical factory, generic drug manufacturer, automobile manufacturer Each archetype and every business model represents different trade-offs between cash, risk and time. The attractiveness of any real business will depend on how well you select and satisfy customers, how well you match demand to the right production processes and how you defend against competitors. Each model has a characteristic pattern of cash flows that are driven by it's unit economics. It is good to compare these models by their [pre-tax operating margin]{.underline}: the percentage of each dollar of revenue that remains after operating expenses have been subtracted. Each of the three archetypal business models has a different relationship between price, unit volume, cost structures, and free cash flows. One way to talk about these patters is in terms of pre-tax operating margin. Pre-tax operating margin is the percentage of each dollar of revenue that remains after operating expenses have been subtracted. To calculate pre-tax operating margin, divide the toal pre-tax cash flow by the total revenue. To estimate it, compare the amount of space taken up by the green bar (pre-tax cash flow), as compared to the total height of the stacked bar (revenue). {width=\"2.8761286089238847in\" height=\"3.9535903324584427in\"} {width=\"3.0930008748906386in\" height=\"4.281165791776028in\"} {width=\"3.1014490376202977in\" height=\"4.351570428696413in\"} {width=\"1.7361111111111112in\" height=\"0.8472222222222222in\"} {width=\"6.5in\" height=\"4.597916666666666in\"} []{#_Toc9463702 .anchor}Making Incremental Improvements A busy entrepreneur must choose between one of four actions as the next focus for improvements in operations: 1. Create a new process. 2. Incrementally improve an existing process. 3. Make a large bet to leapfrog the current operational model. 4. Make serious cost reductions to eliminate costly spare capacity. {width=\"6.5in\" height=\"5.143055555555556in\"} Creating a Culture of Continuous Improvement 1. When your operations are running smoothly, encourage your people to use downtime to look for improvements. Take that time to make minor operational tweaks when the operation is below capacity--- you'll have the time and attention to do so, which won't be true if the plant is pushing 100- percent capacity. 2. Encourage employees to continuously improve, standardize, and delegate tasks. Make sure that all the steps in your process are standardized, documented, and delegated to properly trained people. Take another look at your production process. Are there tasks being done by highly paid employees that have now become routine enough to be performed by lower-cost labor, if only the steps were more simply described? Could automation relieve an employee from a mundane task? 3. Set measurable goals that are tied to incentives, and pay well for exceptional performance. People work for many reasons besides money, but you are foolish to ask them to do things against their own self-interest. Set clear, measurable, objective goals---ambitious but reachable---and pay your people well for exceeding them. You'll be shocked at how many more excellent suggestions you get from workers on the frontline than from newly minted MBAs. 4. Make heroes of your top-performing employees and share their magic. Look for your top-performing employees. What are they doing better than the average employee? Can you make heroes of your top workers? Celebrate them in some way? Ask them to create a manual or video that shows how a task can be improved? Hold a contest to encourage additional innovations? How can you capture the improvements in ways that spread them across the company and encourage more innovation? 5. Keep a close eye on your competitors. What about competitors? Have you heard from your customers or suppliers about process improvements that have been offered by competitors or new entrants? Has there been some sort of technological leap that you've overlooked? Is there an easy way to copy these? 6. Make reducing waste a virtue. Praise those who eliminate waste. Are there ways to use materials more efficiently? Are there extra process steps that can be removed? Is there unnecessary movement of resources or transportation of inventory? Can work-in-process inventories be reduced to lessen inventory costs and improve throughput time? Where in the process do rejects or rework appear? Are quality-control steps placed as early in the process as possible, so that you aren't wasting time and effort on products that will later be rejected because of an early flaw? Can you trace rejects to a systemic flaw in procedures or some sort of variation in the quality of raw materials? 7. Look down the supply chain for gains Can you find suppliers that will deliver materials faster or cheaper? Provide better terms? Are there tasks you can outsource so that you can spend you most precious resources on doing what your customers value most? 8. Look up to your customers for ways to delight them. Ask the sales department to let its salespeople speak directly to those on the shop floor about your customers' needs. Is there something your customer doesn't like doing that you could do for them? {width=\"7.5151520122484685in\" height=\"4.542010061242345in\"} Operational Hiccups {width=\"6.5in\" height=\"3.3756944444444446in\"} Little's Law {width=\"6.5in\" height=\"6.256944444444445in\"} []{#_Toc9463703 .anchor}Operations Midpoint Reflection Pt. 1 []{#_Toc9463704 .anchor}Operations Midpoint Reflection Pt. 2 {width=\"6.5in\" height=\"7.1819444444444445in\"} []{#_Toc9463705 .anchor}Surveying the Battlefield Supply chain distribution network, normally of different firms to get supplies and materials from vendor to customer; e.g., from production to distribution to retailers and to customers Each business in a supply chain also must make frequent decisions about how much inventory to carry to keep goods flowing smoothly Bullwhip effect small changes in demand can rapidly build into sever problems for periods of variable or uncertain demands The longer the supply chain, the less information that is exchanged between firms and the more uncertain demand, the higher the chance of a serious bullwhip effect problem Any link in the supply chain with a bottleneck can affect the entire supply chain network Safety Stock excess inventory apart from demand, to make sure that inventory does not run out\\ Kanban a scheduling system for lean manufacturing and just-in-time manufacturing How to avoid bullwhip effect tracking more closer to the end customer can help better plan for future production levels with less variability and uncertainty (e.g., track monthly sales at the retail level) a. Large retailers or end users can try to keep demand as level as possible by relying on forecasts of future demand to set long term production schedules and contracts. Handling variations in demand by tolerating stockouts or reducing prices to get rid of excess FG inventory. Drawback: puts great pressure on end users to forecast accurately b. Large retailers or end users can either vertically integrate and share information internally between different production stages using a \"Kanban\" approach to send restocking signals or insist that independent firms can share demand information freely. Drawback: powerful end users can use control of the information system to demand concessions from smaller suppliers who might be excluded from the information system if they refuse to lower prices Situation Action When demand exceeds capacity Produce at capacity until demand weakens When demand is unpredictable Information sharing along the supply chain for shorter lead time in production and delivery, and better inventory management When there is competitive disadvantage Information sharing won't be beneficial as somewhere along the supply chain, information may get \"leaked\" and competitors down the supply chain may be able to catch up When demand is predictable Information sharing will be impractical. Instead, utilize all data you have and use historical data, market trends to make forecasts When to maintain high inventory levels: To maintain inventory buffer (safety stock) to avoid running out of FG and missing sales opportunities To take advantage of lower costs by purchasing in bulk To capture rare materials and create a supply bottleneck for competitors Generally, risk is reduced when you collaborate with more than one business at each step in the supply chain (e.g., have multiple sources of RM and distribution). Relying on single source can provide competitive advantage, but could shut down if the only provider also fails. +-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+ | How to optimize supply chain? | | +===================================+===================================+ | Product flow | - Reduce the lead time for | | | products to flow through the | | | supply chain | | | | | | - Minimize the inventory in the | | | system, while ensuring | | | effective flow and supply | | | | | | - Set and maintain quality | | | standards | | | | | | - Reduce costs | | | | | | - When possible, use modular | | | (generic) components that are | | | available from multiple | | | suppliers | | | | | | - Transfer costs and risks to | | | third parties by outsourcing | | | or pushing upstream | +-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+ | Information flow | - Gather and transmit accurate | | | and timely information about | | | orders and delivery status | | | | | | - Share forecast and actual | | | demand data needed to | | | collaboratively synchronize | | | product flow | | | | | | - Gather and share market data | | | that will lead to better | | | sales and profits | | | | | | - Share quality data to enable | | | better quality control | +-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+ | Money flow | - Seek cash or short terms on | | | AR | | | | | | - Seek longer terms on AP | | | | | | - When prudent, extend longer | | | terms on AR in exchange for | | | valuable cooperation: access | | | to market information or | | | preferred delivery schedules | +-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+ +-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+ | Situation | Action | +===================================+===================================+ | When there are multiple vendors | Rely on the market.

It often batches or accumulates demands before issuing an order. There are two forms of order batching: periodic ordering and push ordering. a. Periodic ordering: A company with slow-moving items may prefer to order on a regular cyclical basis because there may not be enough items consumed to warrant resupply if it orders more frequently.\\ \\ One common obstacle for a company that wants to order frequently is the economics of transportation b. Push ordering: a company experiences regular surges in demand. The company has orders \"pushed\" on it from customers periodically because salespeople are regularly measured, sometimes quarterly or annually, which causes end-of-quarter or end-of-year order surges\\ \\ For companies, the ordering pattern from their customers is more erratic than the consumption patterns that their customers experience. The \"hockey stick\" phenomenon is quite prevalent If all customers' order cycles were spread out evenly throughout the week, the bullwhip effect would be minimal Price fluctuation Forward buying results from price fluctuations in the marketplace. This is an arrangement in which items were bought in advance of requirements, usually because of a manufacturer's attractive price offer Rationing and shortage gaming When product demand exceeds supply, a manufacturer often rations its product to customers. The effect of \"gaming\" is that customers' orders give the supplier little information on the product's real demand, a particularly vexing problem for manufacturers in a product's early stages How to Counteract the Bullwhip Effect: information sharing demand information at a downstream site is transmitted upstream in a timely fashion channel alignment coordination of pricing, transportation, inventory planning, and ownership between the upstream and downstream sites in a supply chain operational efficiency activities that improve performance, such as reduced costs and lead time Avoid Multiple Demand Forecast Updates make demand data at a downstream site available to the upstream site electronic data interchange (EDI) to share data upstream site would have access to the demand and inventory information at the downstream site and update the necessary forecasts and resupply for the downstream site vendor-managed inventory (VMI) or a continuous replenishment program (CRP) Another approach is to try to get demand information about the downstream site by bypassing it direct to consumers Break Order Batches smaller batches or more frequent resupply EDI can reduce the cost of the paperwork in generating an order distributors to order assortments of different products. Hence a truckload may contain different products from the same manufacturer instead of a full load of the same product use of third-party logistics companies also helps make small batch replenishments economical customers spread their periodic orders or replenishments evenly over time, they can reduce the negative effect of batching coordinate their resupply with their customers Stabilize prices reduce both the frequency and the level of wholesale price discounting everyday low price (EDLP) or value pricing strategy Activity-based costing (ABC) systems enable companies to recognize the excessive costs of forward buying and diversions explicit accounting of the costs of inventory, storage, special handling, premium transportation, and so on that previously were hidden and often outweigh the benefits of promotions Eliminate Gaming in Shortage Situations instead of allocating products based on orders, it can allocate in proportion to past sales records sharing of capacity and inventory information helps to alleviate customers' anxiety and, consequently, lessen their need to engage in gaming adjust production capacity or scheduling with better knowledge of product demand manufacturers work with customers to place orders well in advance of the sales season enforce more stringent cancellation policies to discourage exaggerating their needs and cancel orders which aggravates gaming []{#_Toc9463707 .anchor}Making a Big Bet in Operations Options in improving operations: 1. Create a new process 2. Incrementally improve an existing process 3. Make a large bet to leapfrog the current operational model 4. Retrench to eliminate costly spare capacity Incrementally improve an existing process Fail early, cheaply and often great incremental path to success, especially when it comes to building the right production process Make a large bet to leapfrog the current operational model Reasons to make a big bet: When equipment to standardize operations will greatly reduce overall costs When costs per unit decline as production volume increases When bundling tasks appeals to customers When size strengthens bargaining power with suppliers and customers When a large leap could discourage new entrants When the costs of a customer defecting are high Ways to Make a Large Operations Leap 1. Lower production costs for existing demand 2. Remove several potential bottlenecks at once. 3. Add an additional production line. 4. Find a new primary process. 5. Embrace a disruptive technology. 6. Go up or down the value chain. 7. Clone geographically. 8. Embrace an entirely new business model. Danger Signs When Considering Big Bets 1. When there's no real advantages to size. 2. When customers are easily lured away by competitors. 3. When a leap adds complexity. 4. When a price war is inevitable. 5. When you have to take on debt. Alternatives to Making a Big Leap Don't feel compelled to take a large leap when it isn't necessary. Outsourcing and refocusing provide alternatives to large, potentially risky investments. Outsource as a Test: Often capacity additions can first be outsourced until demand, new processes or new technology are proven. Say you see a profitable opportunity to expand and don't want to let it pass you by, but the cost of the added capacity could sink the company if you bet wrong. Before you place that big order for machinery, look for a job shop, supplier, or customer with spare capacity. That way you can speed up response time and lower your risks until you have proven the process or market. Of course, outsourcing carries its own risks. Your external provider may not share your standards and commitment to quality. There may be risk in sharing your confidential processes and data. Your provider may drop the ball and fail to deliver on time, cost, and target. Know what you're getting into. Refocus: Some opportunities are ephemeral. In some cases, as your competitors rush to expand, you may be wise to go the other way and refocus. Is there a more profitable segment of your customers that you can focus on? Are there some unprofitable customers you need to fire? It's counterintuitive, but sometimes shrinking revenues leads to stronger and lower-risk free cash flows for you. {width=\"6.5in\" height=\"1.8423611111111111in\"} Making the Decision: start with your current situation. a. Given the current operational setup and constraints, how much free cash flow will your firm generate over the next few years if you forego the big bet to pursue an incremental approach? b. Be sure to take into account how quickly your market is growing, the barriers you have to keep out competitors, and your ability to incrementally add capacity by removing bottlenecks c. Factor in the increases in cash flow that might occur when you reach capacity if you raise prices or fire troublesome customers and replace them with more profitable ones, and conversely the likelihood and impact of luring in a new competitor d.

The Framework is broken into two major parts: 1. Adding value to your business Making incremental investments Creating a more complex business model Adding financing 2. Knowing when to sell. {width=\"6.272224409448819in\" height=\"4.918604549431321in\"} In a way, the progression of the C&V framework mirrors the evolution of a business: As an entrepreneur, you'll first make sunk investments for assets like machinery and commitments to fixed period costs like rent to get the business started. You will be eager to reach cash flow breakeven and payout as soon as possible. As the business grows, you may offer customer credit or add inventories or make new expenditures to grow, all of which create a more complex business model. Once the business model is proven, you may want to add debt to lower your cost of capital; If you have outside investors or run a public company, you'll need to use financial statements to report economic reality to outsiders; and One day, if someone offers you a market price that's more than you believe the business is worth, you may sell the business. Cash Flow Tools The most powerful way to visualize the attractiveness of a business is to project the amount of cold, hard cash the business will produce over time. An entrepreneur calls these cash flows. Valuation Tools Cash flows show you the story of the business's cash over time.The valuation tools in the C&V Framework allow you to calculate the value of a given business opportunity. Defining Value Value = Cash + Risk + Time Sahlman's Four Rules of Cash: 1) More cash is better than less cash. 2) Cash sooner is better than cash later. 3) Less-risky cash is better than more-risky cash. 4) Never run out of cash. The Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) tool will allow you to compare different scenarios of revenue, investments, and costs forecasts by visualizing how each decision will affect the amount of cash your business will create over time. Intrinsic Firm Value measures the value of the firm you have created, based on the FCFF discounted for the time value of money and risk. Free Cash Flow to the Equity (FCFE) models show how much free cash flow is left over for equity holders after interest and principal payments to debtors have been paid. Intrinsic Equity Value the value of the equity based on your free cash flow to the firm projections, is calculated by deducting the market value of the debt from the intrinsic firm value Four Key Principles for the Cash and Valuation Course: Focus your analysis on counting real customers and tangible products. Act like a financial detective, using the questions and tools in this framework to decipher what is happening on the factory floor or within the sales force. Count products and customers. Learn to think of inventory not as a number on a balance sheet but envision it 9 as piles of raw materials or semi-finished goods stacked on the factory floor. Imagine accounts receivable as individual IOUs written by customers. Always begin with adding value to one customer at a time. Start every analysis by determining how you add value, one customer and one sale at a time. The early questions and tools in this framework work best for simple businesses, but they also are the critical first steps for analyzing a highly complex business. You must master the simple tools and skills first before moving to the more complex. Be clear about which question you are asking before you reach for a financial tool. Often students will learn one financial tool and try to use it, no matter what the circumstances. The cash flow modeling and valuation tools presented in the course are each designed to answer specific questions. Do not choose an analytical tool until your goals and the question you are asking is crystal clear. Decide how much weight to put on historical data to drive forecasts. Projections require data. You either can forecast results based on trends in historical data from financial statements or from a bottom-up projection based on the customers, processes, and expected competitive environment in your business (unit economics). Your approach will likely depend on the quality of the data you have and whether you expect imbedded trends to continue or change. The Goal: The main goal of the Cash & Valuation Framework is to help you make the firm and your equity in it as valuable as possible, by building an economic model for your business that is as attractive as possible and can be executed by you in the real world. []{#_Toc9463711 .anchor}Searching for the Mythical Numbers Guru [The overarching financial question for running your own entrepreneurial business is]{.underline}: How do you maximize the long-term value of your equity while minimizing the risk of running out of cash while accurately reporting the results to outside parties? Why Can't You Just Hire a Numbers Guru? So why can't you just hire a \"numbers guru\" to handle all the financial issues? This sounds appealing---until you realize that there are four distinct numeracy skills that you need to run a business and that few \"financial gurus\" are experts in more than one of these areas. Financial gurus come in one of four basic flavors: Auditors, who measure historical expenditures so you can reward the right employee behaviors and accurately report your results to third parties Controllers, who project how changes in prices, sales volume, and fixed-period and variable costs will affect profits and (more importantly) free cash flows Tax experts, who know how to use the intricacies of Internal Revenue Code to minimize tax bills Money raisers, who persuade equity investors or banks to advance funds You, as the entrepreneur, must understand the basics in each of these areas so that you can ask the right questions to ensure you do not have an auditor, a controller, a tax expert, or a money raiser in the wrong position, leading you down a path to ruin. Learning the Hard Way \"On the Job\" As an entrepreneur, you have to stand between the sales department and the operations department to make difficult choices about which customers to serve, which process to use to serve them, and what prices to charge. Solving the financial challenges you will face will require a combination of financial accounting, cost accounting, tax, and money-raising skills, so you cannot delegate them to someone who has only mastered one set of tools. Numeracy is the ability to use numbers to solve a problem in a business. You can pick these skills up through on-the-job experience, with the caveat that you may bankrupt a company in the process. Below is a description of how you can expect your financial literacy to develop if you decide to learn at the \"school of hard knocks.\" You have three choices when it comes to numeracy: 1) You can avoid numerical literacy by sticking to small, cash-based businesses and grow them slowly, so unit economics is the only tool you will need. 2) Or you can learn the lessons the hard way, risking bankruptcy if you lose track of the connection between operating decisions, profitability, and free cash flows to equity, a danger that increases the more quickly you grow or the more heavily you finance with debt. 3) Or finally, you can put in the effort now to practice applying the tools of finance, first with simpler businesses and then with more-complex ones until you can run multiple scenarios to choose the one that adds the most value with the least risk. Never forget that your key objective in building a business is making the tough operating decisions that maximize the value to you and the other equity holders, while minimizing the risk of running out of cash. If you are ever confused, default to Sahlman's four rules of cash. The key to making smart financial decisions is asking the right questions, questions that can be answered from the data you have available. Unit economics may suffice early in the life of a business. Later on, when production processes, sales funnels, and cash cycles become more complex, you will need unlevered free cash flow to the firm to accurately project free cash flows. Free cash flows to the firm and intrinsic firm value come before intrinsic equity value and free cash flows to equity. Free cash flows to the firm depict cash flow projections for the whole pie and intrinsic firm value is the discounted present value of the whole pie. You must bake the pie before you divide it. Intrinsic equity value is the value of the pie that remains for owners, after the costs of debt have been subtracted. Free cash flows to equity tell you if there will be enough cash flow to satisfy fixed debt repayment obligations for interest and principal repayment that comes from debt. Intrinsic value comes before market price. You must know what something is worth to you before you contemplate selling it to someone else. Always seek to maximize the intrinsic value of the firm first. Then see how financing can increase the intrinsic value of your equity. Then, and only then, see if the market will pay you a price that is more than you think the future cash flows are worth. Even with the best financial modeling skills, predicting the future is an inexact science. Your balance sheets should balance and your cash flow projections should be mathematically correct. But far more important than precision is asking the right questions and using judgment to get \"close enough.\" This is no excuse for sloppy work. But, likewise, modeling skills are no substitute for the far rarer and more valuable gift of business judgment. You most have both modeling skills and real-world judgment. []{#_Toc9463712 .anchor}Principles of Cash and Valuation In this note, you will be introduced to Sahlman's Three Principles of Valuation: Principle One: Value = Cash + Risk + Time Principle Two: Sahlman's Four Rules of Cash 1. More cash is better than less cash. 2. Cash sooner is better than cash later. 3. Less-risky cash is better than more-risky cash. 4. NEVER run out of cash. Principle Three: Your goal in a valuation is to \"narrow the region of darkness,\" not calculate a precise value (which is impossible). Hard work and attention to your customers will close any gap between what you pay to acquire and develop an opportunity and what it's worth when you sell it. Remember, your goal in a valuation is not precision---it is setting a reasonable range of possible values. Hard work and satisfied customers will overcome any minor mistakes. Stick with Sahlman's Three Principles of Valuation, and you will never be fooled by frothy markets or fast-talking investment bankers []{#_Toc9463713 .anchor}Pre-Tax Cash Flows, Breakeven, and Payout Do you want to know the secret to staying in business? Sell a unit for more than it costs you to make by performing Unit Economics. That\\'s it? That\\'s it. Or at least it\\'s an important first step. Contribution Per Unit The amount of cash you have left over after selling a unit and paying for its cost is called your \\\"contribution per unit.\\\" Fixed Period Costs & Reaching Breakeven But, you argue, what about rent or salary? If you have these recurring costs---called fixed-period costs---you\\'ll need to sell enough units to pay your monthly bills. That\\'s called \\\"reaching breakeven.\\\" And it\\'s the second most important step in entrepreneurial finance, because now you can stay in business. Payout What about the machine you bought? Yes, you do need to recover that investment. So estimate how much in pre-tax cash flows you\\'ll be making each month once you reach critical mass, and you can calculate how many months it will take to get your money back. That\\'s called \\\"payout.\" Any cash you earn over and above payout is pure gravy.

Define Unit Economics: Unit economics is a financial tool that shows the relationship between annual pre-tax cash flows and changes in revenues, variable costs and fixed-period expenses, like rent and salaries. In other words, for simple businesses, it shows how changes in unit volume will affect revenues, expenses, profits and free cash flows. {width=\"6.484564741907262in\" height=\"4.953488626421697in\"} Which multiple do I use: 5x annual pre-tax cash flow is not always the right multiple depending on the predictability of the cash flows, interest rates, taxes, and a host of other factors. A multiple of five, however, is a good starting place. A multiple of pre-tax cash flows is an excellent proxy for valuation for a simple business, in normal times, but can give misleading results if: A firm's revenues are growing quickly, and the business model of the firm requires reinvesting operating cash flows in working capital or capital expenditures to support continued revenue growth. A firm has substantial fixed assets that are depreciating---in other words, wearing out as items are produced or deteriorating with the passage of time. A firm has a legal form resulting in tax rates that differ from those of alternative investments. The goal is to value the equity (owner's share) of a firm with debt rather than the entire firm itself. []{#_Toc9463716 .anchor}Projecting Revenues Two Fundamental Choices: Projecting Past Sales Trends or Using Market Analysis and Unit Economics You have two choices when it comes to projecting revenues in an established business: You can mechanically extrapolate past sales trends into the future. Or you can deeply examine the different needs of each customer segment, count the number of customers in each segment, and use a sales funnel to predict how quickly leads will turn into paying customers. Projecting future revenues by extrapolating past sales has its advantages. Sales in previous years may reflect deeply embedded customer habits that are likely to continue. Unfortunately, such trends can be difficult to decipher if sales have been erratic. Do you use the past ten years as the basis for your predictions? The past five? Perhaps just the past two? Without understanding the reasons why customers buy your products, it is difficult to explain aberrations in historical data or to know which trends should be honored. Your own optimism (or pessimism) or some preconceived idea may affect which data you pay attention to instead of the trend that best predicts future performance. Understanding what drives the behavior of your customers, dividing them into segments that reflect different needs, counting how many are in each market, and building the right sales funnel to move them along in the sales process can provide far more accurate short-term sales predictions. It is the only choice you have in a start-up business when there are no trends to project. The drawback to such a thorough study, however, is that it is difficult to query large numbers of customers. Also, projections that extend beyond the leads and prospects already in your sales funnel can be little more than educated guesses. Projecting the Past: Extrapolating Historical Results {width=\"6.5in\" height=\"8.50763888888889in\"} {width=\"5.581395450568679in\" height=\"7.3130588363954505in\"} As you can see, the data you choose to include has a dramatic effect on projections and can be influenced by your level of optimism, which has nothing to do with the choices that will be made by real customers. {width=\"6.5in\" height=\"5.250694444444444in\"} Using Unit Economics to Project Revenues If forecasting future revenues by extrapolating past sales is like bombing from 30,000 feet, unit economics is like hand-to-hand combat. With unit economics, you try to crawl inside the head of your customers to predict why they will buy. This gives you a better understanding of the relationship between markets, price per unit, and unit volume, which may lead to more-accurate revenue predictions. Step One: Judging the Intensity of a Need Step Two: Measuring the Tradeoffs Between Substitutes {width=\"4.799458661417323in\" height=\"3.383720472440945in\"} Step Three: Judging the Size of and Penetration Rates for Your Market Step Four: Using Sales Funnels to Forecast Revenues Summary: Projecting revenues, even when done well, often is little more than an educated guess. Projecting revenues is easier when you have a long string of year over year sales increases, showing strong evidence of hordes of customers with deeply ingrained habits that will keep them coming back time and again. You feel more confident when you have a deep understanding of your market, so you understand on a customer-by-customer basis what each person values, which substitutes are available, and the optimum price point that will contribute the maximum contribution per dollar at risk. But even firms with the best market research and most loyal customers can be pleasantly surprised by consumer fads or long periods of economic prosperity. Even firms with the most transparent and forward-looking sales funnels are blindsided by disruptive technologies, irrational moves by competitors, or unexpected downturns in the economy. Learning to make reasonable projections of future revenues, either by projecting past results into the future or building sales projections unit by unit through unit economics (or preferably both), will allow you to compare the commitments you must make to build capacity and assess the risk of not having enough revenues to cover your fixed-period costs and recover your investments. The best defense against the unpredictability of revenues is to stage investments whenever possible, making the minimum sunk investments and fixed-period commitments for different levels of production, provided you allow enough time to add additional capacity when necessary.

Time and again we find entrepreneurs who make large sunk investments, certain that customers will want their product, only to find that a market never existed. Starting with the Customer How you have chosen your customer, your primary sunk investment, and the \"units\" you produce and deliver, will be the difference between success and failure. Unit Economics is a framework to help you make the very best choices possible. An entrepreneur once defined profit as \"over-recovered\" fixed cost. In Unit Economics, you learn to correctly define the sunk investments and fixed costs your venture will require. Then you will see if you are likely to attract enough customers who will buy enough \"units\" at a high enough price to make the investment worthwhile. And you will learn to do all of this before you make the sunk investment. Bridging the Gap Between Demand and Supply An entrepreneur matches a set of needs with the specifications for a product that satisfies that need. The glue that holds these two \"units\" together is the benefit you offer to the customer when using your product---a product that must be better, faster, or cheaper than any other way of satisfying that need. The combination of the \"unit of desire\" inside the customer, the \"unit of production\" given to the shop foreman, and the benefit the customer gets from using the product, successfully bridges the gap and forms the foundation of your business. This is the framework of unit economics. Demand: Customers, Prices, and Volumes You always start with a customer need and what the customer is willing to pay to satisfy it. But this answer is too simple. You cannot survey every customer, ask them what they want, and customize a solution. The cost of discovery and customization is too great. You need to find a group of customers with relatively homogeneous needs. [How do you determine a price?]{.underline} Quantify the maximum value your customer places on your product . This is the highest possible price you could charge (because no one would buy it after that). Measure your costs per unit. (Costs can vary depending on volume, but we'll get to that later. For now, choose a volume and measure cost per unit at that volume). The difference between the max value and the cost per unit is the \"shared value,\" because it's the total value of the product that must get divided up between you and the customer. Decide how much of the shared value you want to keep to yourself and how much you will give to the customer. Your price will be based on how much value you want to keep and concede. All of this works beautifully, until one little problem arises: a competing product or substitute of the same value starts selling for less. With no apparent difference in the value received by the customer, no customer will pay more for your product. So your new ceiling price is the price of the substitute. Decide again how much shared value you want to offer the customer and how much you want to keep, and you've determined your new price. {width=\"5.658536745406824in\" height=\"3.5287248468941383in\"} Value But how does a customer decide on the value of a product? Value is judged in the mind of an individual. The maximum price a customer will pay is set inside the mind of each consumer as they make subjective and sometimes irrational tradeoffs between the money they have, the intensity of the desires they wish to satisfy, {width=\"6.5in\" height=\"3.2729166666666667in\"} The Mistake of Using Costs to Set Prices Many people use a \"cost-plus\" approach to pricing because it is easier to calculate the costs of production than to crawl inside the heads of your customers to measure their whims. That is why this note started with you stumbling onto an empty pipeline, and why so many people take a \"build it and hope they will come\" approach. But setting prices based on costs is a mistake. If costs lead you to price below what your customers are willing to pay, you may give away too much value to the customer. If costs lead you to price above what your customers are willing to pay, you will not sell a single unit, and all of your costs will truly be \"sunk.\" Basing prices on costs can cause you to miss a lucrative opportunity. What is a Primary Sunk Investment? A primary sunk investment is: \u2022 The most important investment a company makes to satisfy its chosen set of customers. \u2022 Either the largest investment the company makes or the asset that would be the most expensive to duplicate. \u2022 A process or asset that allows a company to do the most important tasks again and again in the most efficient way possible to deliver exactly what the customer will pay for. \u2022 The single most important investment to: (1) invent a new product or create a new product; (2) attract customers; (3) manufacture a product; or (4) deliver a product. 15 It typically serves every customer in the same way. {width=\"6.5in\" height=\"4.685416666666667in\"} Summary Unit economics is about making sunk investments---primary sunk investments---where you are confident you can \"over-recover\" the investment to make a profit. When you start your business, it is critical to have defined your primary sunk investment, and the \"units\" its standardized process is designed to deliver. You must understand that the key attributes of these \"units of production\" are critical for satisfying the \"units of desire\" in your subset of customers, how many of these customers are likely to buy and what price they will pay. You then can calculate the variable and fixed period costs required to attract, make, and deliver these units, and how long it will take to recover your primary sunk investment and other start-up costs. All of business---from water pipelines to theme parks---is a matter of making and recovering sunk investments in a standardized set of processes. If you are clear about the \"units\" you are selling, and the primary sunk investment you have made, the chances are much higher that you will \"over recover\" your fixed and sunk costs and survive. []{#_Toc9463718 .anchor}Operating Leverage Understanding how operating leverage works will help you make better decisions with regard to sunk investments and fixed-period commitments. Look for opportunities to bootstrap your operations by keeping most costs variable until demand is proven. Doing this greatly lowers the risk of investing in fixed assets and making fixed-period commitments to add capacity or increase efficiency. Understanding how financial leverage works can help you add enough low-cost debt to boost equity returns, without adding so much that you risk bankrupting your company. Master the use of leverage and, like Archimedes, you'll have one more tool to help you change the world. Operating & Financial Leverage: \"Leverage\" in business describes the relationship between changes in revenues and changes in free cash flows, usually the result of a business model where every sale contributes a large amount toward high fixed period costs. Operating leverage Where as a result of the business model chosen, small changes in revenue will lead to large changes in operating profits and operating cash flows. Operating leverage can supercharge free cash flows if revenue's grow with the risk of bankrupting the firm if they don't. Financial leverage Where because of debt added to a firm, small changes in revenue will lead to large changes in net profits and free cash flows, independent of changes caused by operating leverage. Still don't understand operating leverage? Operating leverage describes how the addition of fixed-period costs in your business model makes operating profits and cash flows more sensitive to changes in revenue. If you choose to keep most costs variable, and fixed-period costs like salary and rent low, your business will survive periods of low sales for as long as you are willing to survive on little to no pay. Unfortunately, your ability to greatly expand sales will be severely limited and the contribution per sale (the amount left over from every sale once variable costs have been paid) will be low []{#_Toc9463719 .anchor}Monkey Ranch 2 []{#_Toc9463720 .anchor}Are You Smarter Than a 5^th^ Grader (Operating Leverage) []{#_Toc9463721 .anchor}Learning to Speak Financial Accounting Components of an Income Statement: {width=\"2.9069772528433946in\" height=\"1.8087860892388452in\"} COGS COGS stands for \"Cost of Goods Sold.\" This line reports all costs directly attributable to the production of the company's product. COGS includes raw material inputs as well as \"direct labor,\" labor applied to making the product. Most of the data from the manufacturing process winds up on this line. Gross Profit Subtracting COGS from Sales leaves Gross Profit. The company must cover its sales, general, and administrative costs out of this difference between total revenue and production costs. SG&A, or Sales, General, and Administrative These expenses, include costs associated with all sales and marketing activities---salaries for salespeople, advertising, and so on---as well as salaries for the company managers and other administrative expenses not directly attributable to sales or manufacturing operations. EBITDA Subtracting SG&A from Gross Profit leaves a measure of company profit called EBITDA ---an acronym that stands for \"earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization.\" For a simple business with no debt or financing, no depreciation on tools, and no taxes, EBITDA is the same thing as cash left over after all inputs, workers, managers, and suppliers have been paid. Put another way, EBITDA is the same thing as the unit economics pre-tax cash flow. Summary When you're considering an increase in sales or a new product launch or a big investment in production capacity, you'll want to do unit economics analysis---that is, to calculate contribution per unit to FPC, sales volume to breakeven on FPC, and how long it will take to recover the money spent on new equipment. Since businesses don't usually report costs and revenue in simple unit economics form, you must learn to get the numbers you need from financial reports, like the income statement. As you dig into an income statement to learn about a business, keep in mind that income statements typically organize information by division---that is, all costs associated with manufacturing will show up under COGS and all costs associated with sales (as well as general and administrative costs) will be under SG&A. Income statements do not distinguish variable from fixed period costs---the information you need to do unit economic analysis. Managers sometimes act as if COGS were \"variable costs\" and 8 SG&A were \"fixed costs.\" While COGS includes all the variable costs of making the product, it may also include fixed period costs such as labor or utilities directly related to manufacturing. In the same way SG&A may include variable costs---sales commissions, for instance---associated with selling the product. If you want to separate the fixed and variable components of COGS (and SG&A), you'll have to take a closer look at how the reported expenses change as sales volume changes. {width=\"7.157370953630796in\" height=\"6.8953488626421695in\"} {width=\"6.461919291338583in\" height=\"1.8604647856517935in\"} {width=\"4.277777777777778in\" height=\"5.208333333333333in\"} []{#_Toc9463722 .anchor}Monkey Ranch 3 []{#_Toc9463723 .anchor}Are You Smarter Than a 5^th^ Grader (COGS/SG&A) []{#_Toc9463724 .anchor}Standing In Between Demand & Supply The Emergence of Business Archetypes Over time, the combination of an entrepreneur's DNA, luck, and the decisions made early in the life of a business, begin to come together to form patterns in the way a business operates. In his Note on Developing Start-up Strategies, Professor Amar Bhide identifies seven cash flow \"archetypes\" that describe the risk and reward characteristics and sustainability of most opportunities. Businesses don't generally \"choose\" one of these strategies; they are developed through trial and error. But by studying the history of businesses that have similar archetypes, you may learn something about what to expect for your own choice of customers, \"units\" and primary sunk investment. [Solo Contracting Ventures]{.underline} A Solo Contracting business has little in the way of a primary sunk investment, differentiation from competitors or barriers to competition. Initial investments and risks are low; as are profit margins and rewards, and the profits continue only as long as the entrepreneur continues to \"hustle.\" It is difficult for an entrepreneur to sell a solo contracting business because it depends so much on the talents and energy of the entrepreneur to survive. In many ways, the entrepreneur does not own the business. It owns him. Lawn services, hairdressers, and other sole proprietors fit this archetype. Most entrepreneurial ventures in the United States are Solo Contracting businesses. [Revolutionary Ventures]{.underline} The Revolutionary archetype is the polar opposite of the Solo Contracting venture. Founders of Revolutionary Ventures typically make a very large primary sunk investment to deliver something radically different to a large group of customers. The risks are enormous and successes rare, but the potential rewards from a Federal Express or Compaq are large as well. Venture capitalists tend to fund Revolutionary Ventures. Other archetypes that fall between Solo Contracting and Revolutionary Ventures on the risk and reward spectrum are: [Institutional Hustle]{.underline} Institutionalized Hustle businesses include law firms, accounting firms, consulting firms, venture capitalists, and investment banking. This archetype is similar to the Solo Contracting archetype, except that there are marginal reasons for practitioners to band together, such as building a reputation or rent sharing. In rare cases, such as McKinsey & Co., there are work processes and training and recruiting protocols that qualify as primary sunk investments. Nevertheless, in most cases, investments and risks are low and profits limited when compared to other archetypes. 31 Like Solo Contractors, those in Institutionalized Hustle businesses thrive mainly because of their individual energy and talent. [Syndication Ventures]{.underline} The Syndication archetype relies on an entrepreneur to bring together various buyers or sellers to create a more efficient market. The size of the primary sunk investment depends on the size and breadth of the market being served. Risk varies depending on how difficult it is to find and convince players to participate. [Trading and Speculation Ventures]{.underline} The Trading and Speculation archetype applies to such industries as oil and gas, real estate, and securities trading. There is a large sunk investment, but it is typically not made in a primary sunk investment to service customers. Instead, entrepreneurs usually make short-term, contrary bets to profit from imbalances in commodity-like markets. [Speed Ventures]{.underline} Speed ventures involve the race to capture a new market created by rapidly changing consumer tastes or technology. Primary sunk investments must be made quickly with little information and few chances to perform methodical \"trial and error\" tests. Sustainability may also be low if the turbulence that led to the first opportunity continues and allows new entrants to leapfrog current competitors. [Niche Ventures]{.underline} In Niche Ventures, the entrepreneur chooses customers with unusual desires that aren't being well served by more standardized competitors. Primary sunk investments are usually limited because production runs and total market size are smaller. The potential rewards are lower than a Revolutionary Venture but may be sustained for long periods if competitors find the small market size unattractive. The best Niche Ventures are those that create sunk assets or processes that may be applied to other segments to create new opportunities. Wrapping Up Unit economics is about making sunk investments---primary sunk investments---where you are confident you can \"over-recover\" the investment to make a profit. When you start your business, it is critical to have defined your primary sunk investment, and the \"units\" its standardized process is designed to deliver. You must understand that the key attributes of these \"units of production\" are critical for satisfying the \"units of desire\" in your subset of customers, how many of these customers are likely to buy and what price they will pay.

All of business---from water pipelines to theme parks---is a matter of making and recovering sunk investments in a standardized set of processes. If you are clear about the \"units\" you are selling, and the primary sunk investment you have made, the chances are much higher that you will \"overrecover\" your fixed and sunk costs and survive. {width=\"6.5in\" height=\"2.723611111111111in\"} The following questions will guide you through these decisions with your own business: \u2022 What is the \"unit of desire?\" How do customers measure it? What are the key physical attributes that satisfy it? \u2022 What price per unit are they willing to pay? \u2022 How difficult will it be to find these customers and convince them to buy? 23 \u2022 What is my Primary Sunk Investment? How will it create value for my customers and a return for my investors? \u2022 How many customers can be reached or serviced by what my Primary Sunk Investment can deliver? \u2022 What are the variable costs to produce each \"unit?\" \u2022 How much in fixed period costs will it take to operate? \u2022 How long does it take to recover my investment? \u2022 How long can I keep competition from reducing my margins? \u2022 What options does this investment give me to make other attractive investments? []{#_Toc9463725 .anchor}Are You Smarter Than a 5^th^ Grader (EBITDA) []{#_Toc9463726 .anchor}Becoming a Financial Detective Three of the most important questions in business are: \u2022 How much cash will you need to invest in your business in the early years? \u2022 How much in excess free cash flow (cash that can be distributed to you and your investors) will your business produce in later years? \u2022 Will the cumulative value of the free cash flows provide enough reward for the time, energy, and investment you've put at risk? Historical Financial Statements The primary purposes of historical financial statements are to: (1) accurately report the financial performance of a business to third parties, and (2) collect a record of transactions so you can reward employees and detect fraud. Financial statements have three main parts: 1) Income statements which capture revenues and expenses so you can calculate and track gross and net profits over a period of time. 2) Balance sheets which record investments in assets and liabilities (financial promises) at a particular point in time. 3) Statements of cash flow which show how much cash has been generated by (or used in) operations, how much cash was used (or generated) by investing in (or selling) assets, and how much cash was provided by (or used to pay off) financings over a certain period of time Historical financial statements are designed to provide a financial record of what has happened in a business. So before you try to use them to make future projections, it's important to understand their drawbacks and limitations. For example: The past is no guarantee of the future. Past results cannot take into account changing customer preferences, surges in raw material costs, or irrational acts by competitors. Use the past to predict the future at your own risk. Historical revenues and expenses on the income statement are reported by function or department. Revenues and expenses on financial statements are collected based on the total expenditures by function or department, so there is no way to directly measure how unit volume, price per unit, variable costs, and fixed-period costs will affect profits and free cash flows. For example: a. Rising prices per unit may create short-term revenue gains, but they often mean that fewer customers will choose to buy in the future. Because the revenue line on an income statement merely reports dollars, there is no way to see how price per unit and unit volume are related. The relationship between decisions on the factory floor and showroom and working capital are obscured. Historical trends in working capital can show you how changes in credit extended to customers (accounts receivable), credit extended by suppliers to the company (accounts payable), or the raw materials requirements to keep the factory running were related to changes in revenues in the past but do not show how underlying economic relationships will drive future results. GAAP depreciation does not necessarily reflect economic reality. While GAAP conventions standardize reporting between companies and make it easier to compare one company's financials to another's, the GAAP depreciation show on your company's financial statements may not reflect the actual wear and tear that's occurring with your fixed assets. A Step-by-Step Guide for Creating an Unlevered Free Cash Flow to the Firm Model From Historical Financial Statements Step 1: Projecting Revenues No matter how much information you have, predicting future revenues is the most difficult task you face, because you have to forecast the actions of fickle customers and whether competitors will be successful in luring those customers away. {width=\"6.104477252843394in\" height=\"4.725752405949256in\"} If you use all the data points, sales appear to be gently climbing. If you use the last four years of data, sales are flat. If you assume the dip in sales in 2006 was an aberration and use the data only from 2004 and 2005, sales seem to be rising quickly. Use only the data from the last two years and sales seem to be plunging. Step 2: Projecting Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) and Sales, General, and Administrative (SG&A) Expenses Of course, you would prefer to know more about Wiley's sales funnel, manufacturing process and general administrative functions, so you could project how the total average cost per unit actually change with unit volume. 5 But if all you have are historical financial statements, the best you can do is infer relationships between revenue and fixed-period and variable costs from previous years, function by function. [There are three steps for projecting future expenses based on historical financial statements:]{.underline} 1. Restate revenue increases in terms of annual percentage increases and common sizing expenses. 2. Tease out fixed-period and variable cost relationships. There are two approaches for estimating the fixed-period and variable cost relationships from historical data when both are present: 1. Graphically (Draw a best-fit curve that describes the relationship between revenues and expenses). 2. The High-Low method (which takes revenue and expense readings at two different points in time and mathematically describes a fixed-period and variable relationship between the two points). 3. Project expenses as a percentage of future revenues. Step 3: Calculating Gross Profits and EBITDA At this point, you decide that Wiley's historical revenues are just too volatile to make any reliable projections of the future. Roadrunner Enterprises seem much more predictable, so you decide to proceed with making unlevered free cash flow to the firm projections for Roadrunner (you remind yourself that Roadrunner's smooth historical growth in revenues is no guarantee of the future, and resolve to dig more deeply into its customer needs and markets before making any sort of offer.) {width=\"6.5in\" height=\"2.171527777777778in\"} The next step in projecting free cash flows to the firm is deducting COGS from revenues to calculate gross profits, and then subtracting SG&A from gross profits to determine the firm's EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization). Note that EBITDA is the same as the annual pre-tax cash flow from unit economics, except that for unit economics the expenses are tracked by variable and fixed-period costs rather than department and function.

Since you haven't yet spent any money on a new machine, this is a \"noncash charge.\" In other words, you are making a note to remind yourself that profits aren't as large as EBITDA suggests and that eventually you will have to buy a new machine. Remember, however, that GAAP has designed financial statements so that the profits from one business can be compared with another's. Allowing each business owner to make a different estimate for depreciation leaves too many chances to manipulate profits, so GAAP has decided how much depreciation you can deduct for certain assets. Unfortunately, these GAAP conventions may bear only a passing relationship to real (economic) depreciation, so your financial statements li {width=\"6.5in\" height=\"5.565972222222222in\"} {width=\"6.5in\" height=\"1.3770833333333334in\"} Step 5: Estimating Federal Income Taxes {width=\"6.2717694663167105in\" height=\"4.802325021872266in\"} {width=\"5.650608048993876in\" height=\"5.476744313210848in\"} Step 6: Checking Trends in Revenue Growth, Gross Margins, and Net Margins for the Effects of Competition It's time to step back from the projections of revenues and costs to take an explicit look at revenue growth rates and gross and net margins. How have revenues and gross and net margins historically changed over time?

If you have a dollar today, you can invest it and earn interest, leaving you with more than a dollar tomorrow. Plus, there's always the chance that tomorrow's dollar may not arrive as promised. The higher the interest rate and the greater the risk, the more valuable the dollar today is by comparison to a dollar tomorrow. An entrepreneur needs to learn to value a business by projecting revenues, expenses, and investments into the future using unlevered Free Cash Flow to the Firm (uFCFF) models. The pattern and timing of the annual free cash flows of a firm will give you a general sense of the value of a business but, if you want a direct way to compare two opportunities, you will need a mathematical formula to weigh the value of a dollar of cash flow in future years with the value of a dollar today. This note describes how to choose a discount rate that will allow you to systematically adjust the value of the Future Free Cash Flows of a Firm to account for the time value of money and the risk that the cash flows will not appear. What's the right discount rate to use for a firm's free cash flows? That depends on how much interest you could earn from an alternative \"risk free\" investment and the added risk of the particular business. Calculating the right discount rate is as much an art as a science and will take you many years to master, but this note will give you some rules of thumb to use as you gain real\u00adworld experience. +-----------------+-----------------+-----------------+-----------------+ | | Capital Asset | Venture | Buffet's 9% | | | Pricing Model | Capital | | | | (CAPM) | Valuation | | | | | Method | | +=================+=================+=================+=================+ | Definition | Uses the past | Use multiples* | Flat 9% | | | instability of | from initial | discount rate, | | | the prices of a | investment | regardless of | | | publicly traded | (e.g., 10x, | | | | stock as a | 20x, 30x) at | current | | | proxy for | time of exit | interest rates, | | | future risk and | | inflation | | | uses this to | *The | expectations, | | | adjust the | price-earnings | or the risk | | | risk-free rate | multiple is the | associated with | | | to determine a | value that the | an investment | | | discount rate | public markets | | | | | place on the | Over the long | | | | earnings of a | run, annual | | | | company.

It is the premium over nominal returns that an investor should expect to receive for bearing the risk of an investment What Is a Discount Rate? A discount rate can be defined as \"the rate of return required by an investor to accept the risks of a certain investment.\" Unfortunately, this becomes a circular definition if you want to use discounted cash flow analysis to value a firm because you will not have good market comparables to calculate the returns required by investors. This means you must use a variety of ways to estimate the returns that an investor might demand. The Preferred Method: Adding a Risk Premium to a Risk\u00adFree Rate The simplest and most direct method for calculating a discount rate is to estimate separately the risk\u00adfree rate alternatives available to an investor and the risk premium that he or she might require to choose this particular investment opportunity. The Risk\u00ad Free Rate A close proxy for a risk \u00adfree rate is the return offered by a US government security that has the same time horizon as the investment in question. If you expect the cash flows from a business to last for five years, look up the five\u00adyear U.S. Treasury bond yield in the Wall Street Journal. If the investment has a ten\u00ad year time horizon, use the yield on ten\u00ad year Treasury bonds. Adjusting for Risk Adjusting for risk is more difficult because it's hard to find exact comparables. One method, and a rather inexact one, is to add a fixed discount rate premium that differs depending on the predictability of the cash flows of the business. The discount rate for the uFCFF of a large stable company might suggest adding 5% to the risk \u00adfree rate while the discount rate for the uFCFF for a small, risky start\u00adup might require a 15% or larger risk premium. Additional risk premiums may be needed to adjust for private 2 (illiquid) companies, industry \u00adspecific risks and the risks to individual companies {width=\"4.527777777777778in\" height=\"2.5555555555555554in\"} Warning! This approach for estimating discount rates is little more than a rough guess. Some large companies can have fickle customers. Some have high fixed \u00adperiod operating costs, where even modest drops in revenues can lead to dramatic reductions in free cash flow. In others, intense competition can lead to rapidly shrinking margins. The uFCFF projections of such businesses, whether large, midsized or small, would be highly uncertain and would require adding higher risk premiums than shown in the table above. Unfortunately, until you have analyzed the unlevered FCFF patterns of scores of businesses in a number of contextual environments, vague approximations like those above will have to do. Don't Compare Apples to Oranges when Matching Discount Rates to Free Cash Flows One of the biggest mistakes when discounting free cash flows is to choose a discount rate that doesn't match the character of the cash flows you are discounting. For example, uFCFF discount rates, by definition, are designed to measure the risk of a firm with no debt. It is incorrect to apply a discount rate designed to measure the risk of the cash flows of a firm to the riskier stream of cash flows for the equity owners after preferential payments to debt holders have been made. When you add debt to a company, debt holders usually demand to receive interest and principal payments before equity holders receive a share of cash flows. Adding large fixed payments of interest and principal (financial leverage) means that even small changes in revenues can lead to large swings in equity free cash flows (particularly if the firm also has high fixed period operating costs). So discount rates for a firm's unlevered cash flows cannot be used to value an owner's equity free cash flows after debt payments have been subtracted. In fact, equity discount rates for highly leveraged transactions are often so high that the compounding effect of the risk premium begins to distort the value of free cash flows in later years. As a result, when trying to calculate the intrinsic value of equity, it is generally better to discount the uFCFF, add the discounted value of the tax shield, and then subtract the market value of the debt. For calculating equity values for 4 companies with extreme amounts of debt, it may even make sense to treat the equity value as an option that has value only in the event that the firm survives a crippling debt load Comparing the Combined Discount Rate With Other Market Proxies The discount rate used to discount the unlevered free cash flows for your firm, calculated by adding a risk premium to the risk\u00adfree rate, can be compared with the returns demanded for similarly risky investments as a sanity check. For example, assume you are trying to value a medium\u00adsized company with a ten\u00adyear time horizon. You note that risk\u00adfree rates for ten\u00adyear Treasury bonds are trading at a 5% yield so, 4 The Internal Revenue Service treats interest expenses as a tax\u00addeductible expense. This means that tax payments go down as interest payments rise. The value created by these foregone tax payments is called the \"tax shield.\" 3 following the preceding example, you add a 10% risk premium to calculate a 15% discount rate for the firm's unlevered free cash flows. But then you note that the senior secured bonds of similar companies are trading at a 15% yield. 5 Since the senior debt holders must be paid first, the senior secured bonds should have a lower interest rate than the discount rate for the unlevered company, so there must be more operating risk in the company than you assumed. Likewise, adding 15% to the 5% yield offered by Treasuries for a small high\u00adtech startup may not be enough of a risk premium if the NASDAQ has just crashed and it is next to impossible to raise new funds for such companies. Other Approaches to Discount Rates Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) The Weighted Average Cost of Capital method (WACC) was developed to give employees in large firms a common discount rate for evaluating internal investment opportunities. Without WACC, each division manager would have to set his or her own discount rate for internal projects, leading to a haphazard internal allocation of capital. WACC estimates the portion of a firm's internal cost of funds attributable to debt and equity separately and then combines them. For the debt portion, WACC uses the average interest rate paid by the firm for debt, adjusted for the value of the tax shield and weighted for the amount of debt in the company. For the equity contribution to the discount rate, WACC takes the equity returns demanded by stockholders, weighted by the amount of equity in the company's capital structure. For example, a company with a 34% tax rate and debt equal to 40% of its firm value, paying a 10% interest rate, with a cost of equity of 20%, would have a WACC of 15%. {width=\"3.837209098862642in\" height=\"1.9488659230096237in\"} WACC works as a discount rate proxy for the internal investment decisions of large firms with stable capital structures. Because it requires an estimate of the cost of equity, which is difficult to 5 Junk bonds are high\u00adrisk, unsecured loans that are similar in risk profile to equity for highly leveraged companies. 4 determine for non\u00adpublic companies, it is less useful for choosing discount rates for levered Free Cash Flows to the Firm for companies with debt in their capital structure. Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) The Capital Asset Pricing Model estimates the discount rates for assets based on the historical relationship between the volatility of stock prices and the subsequent returns for investors in these stocks. CAPM is based on the risk\u00adfree rate demanded by investors, the risk premium investors require to invest in the market, and an added risk premium that reflects the riskiness of an individual company. CAPM Discount Rate = Risk\u00adfree rate + Beta (Market rate -- Risk\u00adfree rate) For CAPM, the risk premium associated with an individual company, called Beta, is based on the historical volatility of the company's stock price. CAPM is widely used in academia but shunned by most in the real world. The idea of using past volatility to forecast future risk doesn't make sense if you are an entrepreneur who has an in \u00addepth understanding of their customers, cost structure, and competitors. Using the logic of CAPM, if the stock of an excellent company with strong cash flows had recently fallen 90%, it would now be more risky, and thus a worse investment, than before its stock price fell. Summary Discount rates offer a way to adjust the value of future annual free cash flows to the present, taking into account the time value of money and risk. As with most valuation issues, the key to discount rates is to get \"close enough\" and to make reasonable assumptions about future free cash flows. Discount rates can be estimated as a combination of a risk\u00adfree rate to compensate investors for the time value of their money and a risk premium that investors will demand in order to invest in a firm like yours (a firm with your customers, your operating leverage and your competitors). 6 A discount rate must be matched to the character of the cash flows that are being discounted. Discount rates for uFCFF cannot be used to discount the firm value or equity of a firm that has debt. Because of the volatility of equity cash flows and the distorting effect of extreme discount rates on later year cash flows, it is generally better to estimate an intrinsic equity value by first discounting the uFCFF, then adding back the tax shield savings as a result of interest payments and subtracting the market value of the debt. Other discount rate approaches, like WACC and CAPM, are not intended for estimating the future value of an entrepreneurial firm and should not be used for this purpose. In general, use discount rates that reflect (as closely as possible) the returns your investors will demand to invest in your business. Then, seek to \"narrow the region of darkness\" to estimate the Intrinsic Value of your firm by running various revenue and cost projections of the uFCFF (including different terminal values) and discount these to the present to compare the present value of the firm under different scenarios. Warren Buffet's 9% Discount Rate The famous long-term investor Warren Buffett reportedly uses a 9% discount rate, regardless of current interest rates, inflation expectations, or the risk associated with an investment. On the surface, this seems preposterous; especially since long-term interest rates and inflation expectations fluctuate widely. Further inspection shows that wisdom often comes in simple packages. Buffett knows that over the long run, annual real returns and inflation have averaged approximately 3% each. In using a 9% discount rate, Buffett is saying that in the long run he believes that nominal rates will average 6% and he wants to make an additional 3% return to compensate him for his investing genius. Buffett uses a consistent discount rate to tell him when to invest and when to sit on the sidelines. In \"good times,\" when inflation is low and too much money is chasing deals, Buffett's discount rate will be too high, and he will be unable to find any interesting investments because others will outbid him. In times when inflation is high or money is hard to find, Buffett's 9% discount rate will lead him to be aggressive, and since there will be few other bidders, he will have his pick of investments that give him the highest net present value at a 9% discount rate. Buffett's Secret: Reflecting Risk on His Free Cash Flow Projections Staying with a 9% discount rate allows Buffett to avoid speculative booms and take advantage of the inevitable speculative busts that follow. Unlike with the Venture Capital Method, by using only a small premium over real interest rates and inflation, Buffett does not use discount rates as a proxy for risk. Instead, he adjusts for risk by projecting more-accurate free cash flows, running multiple scenarios, and using debt and options to make sure that in all but the worst-case scenarios, he is likely to recover his investment. Those who use the CAPM or the Venture Capital Method are estimating risks from 30,000 feet, using analytical cleverness to avoid understanding the nuts and bolts of a business. Buffett revels in the nuts and bolts, understanding in simple terms why customers buy, how products are made and delivered, and how competitors can be kept at bay. If Buffett can make a 6% real rate of return over a long period of time, he will own an even larger piece of the world than he does now. A Warning About Using A 9% Discount Rate Remember that Warren Buffett has a lifelong track record of understanding the fundamental risks of a business. He avoids businesses that he does not understand or that do not allow him to adjust for the overconfidence of the forecaster. If you use a 9% discount rate and are unable to adjust overly optimistic cash flows back to reality, you will tend to overvalue opportunities. Buffett's method is not an excuse to blindly increase your valuation by using a low discount rate but instead is an admonition to learn more about the customers, cost structure, and competitive environment of the business you are studying Summary High-powered analysts run endless spreadsheets to calculate betas. Reportedly gifted venture capitalists use discount rates of 50% to 75% to value an opportunity. Could such approaches be misguided? There is a difference between cleverness and wisdom. Fancy theories and mathematical formulas may make you feel smarter, but they are dangerous tools when used to avoid a common sense understanding of the opportunity you are analyzing. Warren Buffett's reported use of a 9% discount rate is simple, but not simplistic. It gives him an unwavering sense of whether markets are exuberant or depressed and---provided that his analysis of fundamental cash flows is sound---provides an accurate estimate of value. Understand the fundamentals of a business. Run multiple free cash flow projections. Use convertible debt or other types of options to protect yourself from downside cases and invest only when the market is pessimistic about the future---and you can be wise too. []{#_Toc9463732 .anchor}Estimating Terminal Values What Is a Terminal Value? This note introduces the concept of a terminal value, a way to combine the later year cash flows of a business into a single lump sum, so you can more easily determine the value of the business today. As the owner of a business, you are entitled to the free cash flows of a business in perpetuity. But, practically speaking, after a certain point your projections seem to be little more than a wild guess. You don't want to give away these final years of your firm's free cash flows for nothing, but you aren't quite sure how to include them in your valuation model. Terminal Values help with this dilemma by giving you a short hand way to lump the free cash flows beyond a certain date into the final year of your free cash flow projections. This lump sum is then discounted back to the present to determine its value to you today. Terminal Values are---at best---an educated guess, but even if your crystal ball is cloudy, the free cash flows that occur beyond your projection period will likely be worth something. It's your job to account for this value as best you can. +-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+ | | EBITDA multiple | Perpetuity with | | | method | Growth (PWG) method | | | | | | | (multiple free cash | (extrapolating | | | flows) | stable CF growth far | | | | into the future) | +=======================+=======================+=======================+ | Definition | Uses a proxy for the | Terminal value is | | | free cash flow | calculated by taking | | | generating capacity | the UFCFF in the year | | | of the firm (EBITDA) | following the | | | in the terminal | terminal year and | | | | dividing it by the | | | year, and multiplies | difference between | | | it by a number meant | the discount rate and | | | to represent what a | the annual expected | | | buyer at that point | growth rate of the | | | in time might | after-tax | | | | | | | pay for the right to | uFCFF | | | all free cash flows | | | | to come | Terminal Value (PWG) | | | | = (Annual Free Cash | | | Terminal value | Flow to the Firm the | | | (EBITDA multiple) = | year after the | | | EBITDA multiple X the | terminal year) / | | | EBITDA in the | | | | terminal year | (After-Tax Discount | | | | Rate -- Stabilized | | | | Growth Rate of the | | | | firm's free cash | | | | flows) | +-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+ | Multiples | -

There is no easy answer to the question of how far you should project the free cash flows of a firm before you stop to estimate a terminal value. Theoretically, you would prefer to forecast the individual components of revenue, expenses, and investments until you have saturated your market and your revenue growth tracks the growth rate of the overall economy. In practice, however, few businesses survive that long without experiencing some shock due to contextual changes or competition, so long-lived cash flow projections may be unrealistic. So once you reach the limits of your ability to make credible estimates of revenues, expenses, and investments (the terminal year), it is time to stop making discrete forecasts of annual free cash flows and instead lump all cash flows beyond the final year into a single \"terminal value\" that can be added to the final year's operating cash flow. As shown in the example below, if a business (Business A) is well established with loyal customers, a large potential market, few substitutes, a stable cost structure, and benign competitive pressures, you may project free cash flows for as long as ten years before summing all subsequent free cash flows into a terminal value. In other cases (Business B) you may believe that you will saturate a market and reach a point of diminishing returns on sales growth within five years or less, so your terminal value calculation may come much sooner. {width=\"5.779069335083115in\" height=\"3.982988845144357in\"} What Methods Can You Use to Compute a Terminal Value? There are several different approaches you can take for estimating a terminal value. All implicitly take into account the future growth in revenues, expenses, and investments and prevailing interest rates in the terminal year. Two of the most popular approaches are using a multiple of free cash flows (the EBITDA Multiple method) and extrapolating stable cash flow growth far into the future (the Perpetuity with Growth method.) EBITDA Multiple Method The EBITDA Multiple method uses a proxy for the free cash flow generating capacity of the firm (EBITDA - earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) in the terminal year, and multiplies it by a number meant to represent what a buyer at that point in time might pay for the right to all free cash flows to come. Terminal value (EBITDA multiple) = EBITDA multiple X the EBITDA in the terminal year. How large a multiple is reasonable? It depends on how long you expect the cash flows to continue at the current rate. If your business is predicted to have reasonably strong competitive barriers and steady sales, in a normal interest rate environment a multiple of 5X EBITDA might be reasonable. In other words, a buyer might pay you five times the pre-tax cash flow to the firm in the final year of the projections because he or she believes that the cash flows would continue at this level (or higher) for enough time (at least five years) for the investment to be attractive. If your company is a service business with few barriers and interest rates are abnormally high, a multiple of as little as 2X to 3X EBITDA may be reasonable. In this case, a buyer may believe that the cash flows are so fragile that they may not continue beyond a few years or so. Likewise, if interest rates are low and the company has extremely high barriers to competition, some analysts use EBITDA multiples of 8X to 10X or even higher. Here, the cash flows from the business look so steady, and the returns from alternative investment choices are so low, that a buyer will place a much higher value on the terminal year cash flow. {width=\"4.383720472440945in\" height=\"2.0530096237970255in\"} Warning: EBITDA multiples work best for estimating a terminal value for businesses that have stable revenues and margins. It does not work well for fast-growing businesses, particularly those with operating leverage, heavy working capital investments or recurring capital expenditures. Perpetuity With Growth Method (PWG) With the Perpetuity with Growth method, the terminal value is calculated by taking the Unlevered Free Cash Flow to the Firm in the year following the terminal year and dividing it by the difference between the discount rate and the annual expected growth rate of the after-tax uFCFF. Terminal Value (PWG) = (Annual Free Cash Flow to the Firm the year after the terminal year) / (After-Tax Discount Rate -- Stabilized Growth Rate of the firm's free cash flows) In essence, this formula is calculating the perpetual value of a stream of after-tax cash flows, rising at a steady rate, relative to the after-tax cost of funds (the discount rate). For example, assume your firm's after-tax cash flow stream from a business was \\$1 million in the year after the terminal year. You believe that the after-tax free cash flows to the firm will grow at 5% a year forever and that the correct after-tax discount rate is 10%. Terminal Value (PWG) = \\$1 million / (.10 -- .05) = \\$1 million / .05 = \\$20 million Warning: The Perpetuity with Growth formula assumes that the growth rate in aftertax cash flows will continue forever (in perpetuity) and that the discount rate is based on reasonable risk-free rates. The PWG method will deliver absurdly high terminal values if you use a standardized growth rate that is higher than the historical growth rate for the general economy or a discount rate based on historically low risk-free rates. In other words, your business cannot grow faster than the general economy forever or eventually it will represent 100% of the world's GNP. Likewise, abnormally low interest rates will eventually revert to historical means. Ignoring these caveats will result in absurdly high terminal values. The PWG method also does not work well for businesses with a high degree of operating leverage, since small changes in revenues can lead to explosive growth (or decline) in free cash flows, rather than the steady changes assumed by the PWG formula. How Do You Calculate a Terminal Value for a Business That Has Rapid Free Cash Flow Growth or Other Complications? How do you calculate a terminal value for a business with rapid revenue growth, high operating leverage, or continued heavy working capital and fixed asset investments? Quite simply, there is [no accurate way to calculate a value under these circumstances.]{.underline} You must run the UFCFF projections long enough to saturate your market until the growth in free cash flows begins to approximate the growth of the overall economy. Choosing Between Terminal Value Methods How do you choose between methods? Entrepreneurs tend to use the [EBITDA Multiple method with low multiples when buying]{.underline} (because the terminal value will be conservative) and the [Perpetuity with Growth method with high growth rates and low discount rates when selling]{.underline} (because the terminal value will be aggressive). Academics seem to prefer the more complex Perpetuity with Growth method. The most important thing to remember is that all terminal value methods rely on uncertain projections made far into the future, and so any terminal value is little more than an educated guess. Discounting a Terminal Value as Part of Calculating Intrinsic Firm Value The whole purpose of estimating a terminal value is to use it to determine your Intrinsic Firm Value, the value of your estimated future free cash flows to you. This means that you must add this figure to the final year's annual unlevered Free Cash Flow to the Firm (uFCFF) and discount all of the annual cash flows back to the present. It also is important to decide whether or not you need to deduct taxes from the terminal value in the final year. With the PWG method, you are extrapolating the value of the after-tax free cash flows, so there is no need to deduct taxes as if the company was sold in the final year. Likewise with the EBITDA method, where you are selling the company in the final year, any taxes will be paid by individual shareholders and not the company, so taxes do not need to be deducted from the company's free cash flows to the firm. {width=\"6.5in\" height=\"2.4305555555555554in\"} The only time taxes need to be deducted from a terminal value is if it is assumed that the firm's assets will be liquidated and taxes are paid on any gains. Summary As the owner of a business, you are entitled to its free cash flows in perpetuity. So while your ability to accurately project free cash flows diminishes with time, you do want to receive value in a harvest for the cash flows beyond the terminal years of your projections. Terminal values provide a way to capture the value of free cash flows that occur beyond the final year of your projections, so you can add this value to the final year of your Unlevered Free Cash Flow to the Firm projections to determine the Intrinsic Firm Value today. Use the EBITDA Multiple method or the Perpetuity with Growth methods to estimate a Terminal Value only if the free cash flow in the Terminal Year has slowed to at or below the growth rate of the overall economy. You cannot use the PWG or the EBITDA methods for a business with rapid revenue growth, operating leverage, or heavy working capital and capital expenditure investments. Above all, never forget that however you arrive at a terminal value, it is at best an imprecise and imperfect look into the future. Those who buy businesses based on large terminal values that lie far into the future are, by definition, making a risky bet on events far beyond their vision or control.

How long would you expect it to take for this company to turn cash flow positive? Unfortunately, you cannot answer this question without understanding the working capital requirements. If the business, as in the following example, is steadily increasing sales, must pay its suppliers cash on delivery, gives its customers 120 days to pay debts, and keeps 30 days of inventory on hand, it will not be until the third year that the business will turn cash flow positive. [If you do not understand how working capital affects free cash flows, you can find yourself running a very profitable business that runs out of cash and dies.]{.underline} Components of Working Capital Accounts Receivable Accounts receivable is credit extended to a customer so he or she can take delivery of a product today and pay later. For a lemonade stand, this is the money owed to you by your big brother and his friends because they bought lemonade on credit, promising to pay you in seven days when they get their allowance. While waiting for your brother and his friends to pay, your lemonade stand may show a profit but be losing cash. You want to keep your accounts receivable days as short as possible, because you need the cash coming in the door from customers to pay workers, suppliers, banks, taxes, etc. To calculate accounts receivable, you first determine what terms you will offer your customers (30-day terms would mean that they can take the lemonade now, provided they pay you within thirty days). Next, you determine how much you are selling per day (i.e. sales / days in period). Last, you multiply the sales per day by the payment terms you have given your customers: Accounts Receivable = (Total Revenue / Days in Period) x Days Receivable So if you earned \\$1,000,000 in revenue for the year, and had 30-day payment terms with your customers, your accounts receivable would be: (1,000,000 / 365) x 30 = \\$82,192 There is a delicate balance in managing accounts receivable that can be obscured by gross generalizations like the calculations above. On one hand, you do not want to tie up valuable cash by extending credit to customers who don't demand it; and you especially want to avoid extending credit to deadbeat customers who later will refuse to pay. On the other hand, there may be some customers who will pay a far higher price per unit, and buy in large volumes, if only you will extend credit for a short period of time. For these reasons, you cannot afford to look at accounts receivable simply as a line item on a balance sheet. Rather, it should be viewed as a customer-by-customer investment that must be weighed individually, based on the long-term value of a particular customer relationship. Inventory Inventory describes the stocks of raw materials, work in process, and finished goods you must keep on hand to maintain a smooth flow of salable goods for your customers. Inventory is an inherently forward-looking calculation (how much lemonade do I need on hand to serve all of my customers today?). As such, projected inventory should be based on the amount of product you anticipate selling in the upcoming period. Inventory = (Inventory Days x COGS) / 365. So, if your COGS for next year is projected to be \\$4,000,000, and you want 15 days of inventory on hand, your inventory at the end of this year is: (\\$4,000,000 / 365) x 15 = \\$164,384 In general, the less inventory a business needs, the better. Inventory ties up valuable cash. It can also spoil, go obsolete or become lost, damaged or stolen while waiting to be purchased. Unfortunately, here too, there is a delicate balance. If you scrimp too much on inventory, shortages may occur at different places in your assembly line, leading to a less efficient use of manufacturing assets. Likewise, a lack of finished goods inventory may lead to stock outs of popular items and cause impatient customers to go elsewhere. Accounts Payable Accounts payable describes the credit extended to you by suppliers. In a way, accounts receivable is the reverse of accounts payable, because now you are the one who can buy today and pay tomorrow. Another way to think about accounts payable is that it describes the portion of your inventory that suppliers are willing to finance, in return for you agreeing to be their customer. Businesses like to have payable days as large as possible, as that means they are essentially getting a short-term, interest-free loan from their vendors. To calculate accounts payable, you would use a formula very similar to the accounts receivable calculation, but instead of calculating sales per day, you calculate COGS per day: Accounts Payable = (Total Cost of Goods Sold / Days in Period) x Payable Days2 If the COGS for the year were \\$500,000 and you had 30-day payment terms with your suppliers, your accounts payable would be: (500,000 / 365) x 30 = \\$41,096 Here too, there is a balancing act. You want to stretch your credit with suppliers as far as possible, but not so far that they start to demand higher prices or offer inferior service. Like accounts receivable, accounts payable should not be considered simply another line on the balance sheet, but rather a series of supplier-by-supplier negotiations, where the amount of credit demanded depends on the service required and amount of leverage you have with the individual supplier. Example 1: How Working Capital Can Make Life Harder The company described earlier is a young manufacturing firm. Because it has no credit history, its suppliers demand cash payments. The market is already quite crowded, so to attract customers, it must offer 120-day payment terms. To further sweeten the deal for new customers, the firm has guaranteed product availability, which in this case means it must keep 30 days of inventory on hand. The company is profitable from Day 1 but, because of the working capital requirements, it is cash flow negative for the first two years. Example 2: How Working Capital Can Make Life Easier The second company we will look at is in a very different situation. This is Acme-Mart, the largest discount retailer in the world. All of its customers pay in cash. Because it is so large and powerful in comparison to any one vendor, it can command 120-day payment terms from its suppliers. It also has very rigid delivery timelines with its suppliers and so only has to keep five days of inventory on hand (all numbers are in tens of billions). Conclusion Working capital is every bit as real an investment as the purchase of a building or an assembly line machine. The amount of working capital your business will need will depend on the length and complexity of your assembly line or service delivery process, the amount of credit your customers demand, and the willingness of suppliers to extend credit. Working capital is not simply a series of lines on a balance sheet, but a reflection of trade-offs made in the production process and selection of customers and vendors. As your business grows, its margins narrow, and your needs for working capital intensify, your ability to anticipate and manage working capital will have a growing impact on your subsequent free cash flows.

When is borrowing money for your business a good idea? When is it dangerous? These questions may seem simple, but many entrepreneurs get into trouble precisely because they fail to ask the most fundamental questions about borrowing money. The nature of some entrepreneurs is to pursue growth at all costs, borrowing as much as possible; others are so risk averse that they refuse to even consider debt, even when it would substantially lower their cost of capital. You need to grasp the basics of debt, or you risk that your company's debt levels will be determined by your personal feelings about money, rather than what's right for the business. The right approach is to consider external financing as just another asset---you can either \"rent\" money by borrowing it or \"buy\" it by selling some of your equity. The right amount of debt for your company will depend on whether or not the profits from additional growth exceed the costs, risks, and loss of control that come from promising fixed payments of interests and principal to debtors. This note describes the basics of debt, its advantages, disadvantages, and dangers so you can decide how much debt, if any, is right for your company. What is Debt? Debt is money advanced by a third party (a lender) in return for a promise by the borrower to pay rent (interest) for the use of the funds and repay the amount loaned (principal). The loan repayment usually occurs in a single payment or a series of set payments, either on a set date or on a series of dates. In other words, a lender says to you, \"You can use my money as long as you pay me 'rent' for the privilege of using it and agree to return it when you are finished.\" Debt can be thought of as being just like any other asset rented by a business. Borrowing a pile of cash is comparable to signing a lease on an office building. Interest, calculated as a percentage of the unpaid debt,2 is the rent you pay to use someone else's money One final issue: Typically debtors have priority over the equity rights of owners, which means debtors get paid first and the owners of a business (the equity holders) get paid only after all obligations to debtors have been satisfied. The Advantages of Debt There are five main reasons to use debt when financing a business: 1. You need to provide funds for working capital or fixed assets for a rapidly growing business that cannot be financed from its own internal free cash flows but does have assets (like inventory and accounts receivable) that can easily be resold 2. Debt is cheaper than equity. 3. Interest payments are subsidized by the federal government. 4. The financial leverage of a loan disproportionately increases returns if your business is 5. Nonrecourse debt creates option value. The Dangers of Debt Many of the advantages of debt for a business that does well become disadvantages---sometimes even fatal mistakes---if a business stumbles or muddles. 1. Compulsory principal and interest payments increase fixed-period costs and require higher sales to reach breakeven cash flows. 2. Even low interest rates can consume most of the profits of a low-margin, capital- intensive business or a business that muddles. 3. The first rights to cash flow and covenants (\"thou shall nots\") required by debt holders can reduce flexibility Summary All too often, an entrepreneur's appetite for debt is based more on personality traits than cold, hard analysis. Some entrepreneurs will borrow as much money as possible to finance skyrocketing growth, only to later lose their companies because the high interest expenses eliminated profit margins, resulting in the inability of free cash flows to service the debt. Conversely, other entrepreneurs are so risk averse that they refuse to even consider debt, even when it would substantially lower their cost of capital. The decision of whether to take on debt is the same as the decision to acquire any asset in a business. Do your projections of free cash flows suggest that the profits from additional growth and lowering the costs of financing (including the benefits of tax-deductible interest payments) exceed the costs and risks from higher fixed-period costs and a loss of operating control and flexibility? If so, consider debt. If not, avoid it. [Basis for priority]{.underline}: During normal operations : a. Royalties or commissions generally come \"off the top\" and are paid first, even if the business is operating at a loss. b. Next, operating expenses and taxes are paid. c. Then debt holders have a right to specified payments of interest and principal repayment. d. Finally, equity holders (owners) have the right to all remaining cash flows after royalties and commissions, operating expenses, taxes, and debt have been paid. e. Hybrid securities may have characteristics of both debt and equity and can include an option to convert debt-like rights to equity-like rights, depending on the performance of the business. {width=\"6.25in\" height=\"0.9604166666666667in\"} In bankruptcy : f. Holders of senior secured debt may seize assets that have been pledged as security and sell them to satisfy claims. g. If any value remains, holders of senior debt are then paid. h. Unsecured creditors are next in line to be paid, in descending order of priority as defined by loan agreements. i. Preferred shareholders are paid only if there is value left over after unsecured creditors have been paid. j. Common shareholders are paid only after everyone else has been satisfied. {width=\"6.25in\" height=\"3.36875in\"} [Debt Holders]{.underline} : Holders of senior secured debt have a mortgage on certain assets and > may seize these assets, sell them, and take as much cash as > necessary to satisfy their claims. If anything is left over, it is > passed to the group with the next highest priority. Those holding senior unsecured debt have the first right to excess > proceeds from the sale of secured assets and the proceeds from the > sale of unsecured assets. The claims of subordinated debt are explicitly placed behind those > of more senior classes of debt [Equity Holders]{.underline}: Preferred stockholders have the right to receive a stated stream of dividend payments before common shareholders receive any dividends. In a bankruptcy, preferred stockholders are paid before common stockholders. Common stockholders are paid last but have the right to all the cash that is left over after all prior claims are paid. Warrant and option holders have the right, but not the obligation, to buy a defined number of shares of common stock at a set price. These rights are not likely to be exercised unless the stock is trading above the set exercise price Schedule of priority: Create amortization tables Estimate the Free Cash Flow to the Firm Under Various Scenarios Calculate Payments Available for Debt and Equity Holders in Each > Scenario Show Returns to Debt and Equity by Class Calculating an Expected Value assign a probability for each > scenario, calculate NPV The key to unraveling priority is to clearly understand where each investor stands by asking questions such as: During normal operations, how are free cash flows shared? Are distributions at the discretion of management or are they mandatory? Is each payment defined as a share of sales, a percentage of profits, or a set amount of interest or principal? If there isn't enough cash to satisfy all obligations, who stands at the front of the line? The amortization table will allow you to: Translate the written terms of a loan contract into a table showing > the dollars in interest and principal you will be required to pay > and when they will be due.

It is more than just a job you have created for yourself, but rather, it is there to serve you. The Law of Objectivization: View your business as separate from you - as a product of you - and you will be able to reinvent it. It is about taking a step outside of your business and looking at it objectively. Working ON it not IN it: The business as a whole is the product, not the things or the services the business produces. You need to be focused on building your business, not merely cranking out products or services. Systemization: View your business as an integrated system. The system does the work, and people run the system. Business Development Cycle: The task of the owner is continuous development of the business through the ongoing process of innovation, quantification, and orchestration. Having great technical skills does not mean you know how to run a business. Think of your business as a national franchise, then start with one store. Build a system of systems, so your business doesn't rely on people's skills.

A price is really just a proxy, a number used to state one person's subjective value of an object or service, stated in a currency, like dollars and cents. Most entrepreneurs think of price in one of three ways: Cost-plus based pricing takes the cost in time and materials to make and deliver a product and then adds a cushion of profit. The profit added may be a fixed amount or it may vary as a percentage of cost. Cost-plus pricing has the benefit of being relatively simple: It's fairly easy to calculate the cost of a product and add a margin of profit. The drawback to cost-plus pricing is that it doesn't consider the value added for customers, meaning you could be pricing far lower than necessary, and leaving substantial profits on the table. Value-based pricing focuses on the benefit perceived by customer. The advantage to value-based pricing is that it attempts to capture some or most of the value you create. The drawback is that it requires you to \"put yourself in a customer's shoes\" to discover how much value a customer places on your product or service. Since this is a subjective and ever-changing number, it is difficult to estimate for even one customer, much less a heterogeneous collection of customers. Value-based pricing focuses on the benefit perceived by customer. The advantage to value-based pricing is that it attempts to capture some or most of the value you create. The drawback is that it requires you to \"put yourself in a customer's shoes\" to discover how much value a customer places on your product or service. Since this is a subjective and ever-changing number, it is difficult to estimate for even one customer, much less a heterogeneous collection of customers. Pricing in the Real World: Sharing the Value You Create with Customers So which of the three approaches to pricing is best? Actually, none of them in isolation, all of them in concert. Each approach---cost-plus pricing, value-based pricing, and competition-based pricing---has its merits, but each is only a static way to think about pricing. But pricing isn't a static concept. It's a dynamic conversation between entrepreneurs and consumers, a way of dividing the value created by trading, set amidst the competitive landscape of companies trying to steal each other's most marginal customers. Three important observations about prices 1. Setting a price determines how a company and its customer share the value created in a transaction. 2. Advertising and education can increase the overall value of a transaction, allowing you to raise the price per unit. 3. Competitive pressures can force you to lower prices, even to a point that forces you into bankruptcy. What Is the \"Right\" Price? So price per unit can vary all the way between variable cost per unit (at least in the short run) and the maximum benefit offered to the customer, if the customer is fully aware of the benefit and has no other alternatives (substitutes). So where should you price in this continuum? Apart from any type of legal constraints or consideration of competitors' pricing, the decision largely depends on: The type of product or service you are offering A. Impulse Needs (Impulse items are products or services a customer buys largely because \"they are there\" when the mood strikes. Think of a candy bar or a child's toy or a magazine sold at the checkout aisle of the supermarket). B. Utilitarian or Functional Needs (These typically involve a need where the value can be rationally computed by the customer. Think of consumers calculating the benefit of buying a lawnmower and mowing the yard themselves versus paying a landscaping service). {width=\"6.5in\" height=\"3.1145833333333335in\"}c. Image or Complex Needs (These usually say something about the user's identity (for consumer goods) or involve solving complex problems for business customers). 2. Whether your strategy is to \"skim\" or \"penetrate\" a market Your financial and pricing strategy can often be simplified as a decision to skim and price as high as possible, or to penetrate and price low to capture a large share of a market quickly. Skimming means pricing high to skim the highest need customers, adding successive segments of increasingly lower-need customers to build volume. Penetrating means pricing low to attract as many customers as quickly as possible, so you can spread large fixed-period costs over as many units as possible. {width=\"6.5in\" height=\"1.68125in\"} Summary Many take prices for granted, seeing them simply as the amount of money you pay or receive for a product or service. But the savvy entrepreneur sees prices, and the art of pricing, as a far more complex dance, the creation and sharing of value between company and customer, performed in the presence of competitors who are trying to steal customers. One of the miracles of the free market is that, in the absence of fraud or coercion, no sale ever takes place between a buyer and seller that doesn't add value for both. Price is simply the result of an agreement of how the rewards will be shared between the parties. No matter what type of product and service you choose to make and deliver, or whether you plan to skim or penetrate a market, pricing will remain an art---subject to trial and error, practice and mastery---more than a science of market studies and calculation. Practicing this art, and continuing to look for new ways to add value to customers, while avoiding the ruinous price wars that come from competing on price alone, almost certainly may add to your profits, and just may save your business.","title":"The Art of Pricing Pt. 1"},{"location":"artofpricing1/#the-art-of-pricing-pt-1","text":"","title":"The Art of Pricing Pt. 1"},{"location":"artofpricing1/#what-is-a-price","text":"A price is really just a proxy, a number used to state one person's subjective value of an object or service, stated in a currency, like dollars and cents.

Time and again we find entrepreneurs who make large sunk investments, certain that customers will want their product, only to find that a market never existed. Starting with the Customer How you have chosen your customer, your primary sunk investment, and the \"units\" you produce and deliver, will be the difference between success and failure. Unit Economics is a framework to help you make the very best choices possible. An entrepreneur once defined profit as \"over-recovered\" fixed cost. In Unit Economics, you learn to correctly define the sunk investments and fixed costs your venture will require. Then you will see if you are likely to attract enough customers who will buy enough \"units\" at a high enough price to make the investment worthwhile. And you will learn to do all of this before you make the sunk investment. Bridging the Gap Between Demand and Supply An entrepreneur matches a set of needs with the specifications for a product that satisfies that need. The glue that holds these two \"units\" together is the benefit you offer to the customer when using your product---a product that must be better, faster, or cheaper than any other way of satisfying that need. The combination of the \"unit of desire\" inside the customer, the \"unit of production\" given to the shop foreman, and the benefit the customer gets from using the product, successfully bridges the gap and forms the foundation of your business. This is the framework of unit economics. Demand: Customers, Prices, and Volumes You always start with a customer need and what the customer is willing to pay to satisfy it. But this answer is too simple. You cannot survey every customer, ask them what they want, and customize a solution. The cost of discovery and customization is too great. You need to find a group of customers with relatively homogeneous needs. How do you determine a price? Quantify the maximum value your customer places on your product . This is the highest possible price you could charge (because no one would buy it after that). Measure your costs per unit. (Costs can vary depending on volume, but we'll get to that later. For now, choose a volume and measure cost per unit at that volume). The difference between the max value and the cost per unit is the \"shared value,\" because it's the total value of the product that must get divided up between you and the customer. Decide how much of the shared value you want to keep to yourself and how much you will give to the customer. Your price will be based on how much value you want to keep and concede. All of this works beautifully, until one little problem arises: a competing product or substitute of the same value starts selling for less. With no apparent difference in the value received by the customer, no customer will pay more for your product. So your new ceiling price is the price of the substitute.

Value is judged in the mind of an individual. The maximum price a customer will pay is set inside the mind of each consumer as they make subjective and sometimes irrational tradeoffs between the money they have, the intensity of the desires they wish to satisfy, {width=\"6.5in\" height=\"3.2729166666666667in\"} The Mistake of Using Costs to Set Prices Many people use a \"cost-plus\" approach to pricing because it is easier to calculate the costs of production than to crawl inside the heads of your customers to measure their whims. That is why this note started with you stumbling onto an empty pipeline, and why so many people take a \"build it and hope they will come\" approach. But setting prices based on costs is a mistake. If costs lead you to price below what your customers are willing to pay, you may give away too much value to the customer. If costs lead you to price above what your customers are willing to pay, you will not sell a single unit, and all of your costs will truly be \"sunk.\" Basing prices on costs can cause you to miss a lucrative opportunity. What is a Primary Sunk Investment? A primary sunk investment is: \u2022 The most important investment a company makes to satisfy its chosen set of customers. \u2022 Either the largest investment the company makes or the asset that would be the most expensive to duplicate. \u2022 A process or asset that allows a company to do the most important tasks again and again in the most efficient way possible to deliver exactly what the customer will pay for. \u2022 The single most important investment to: (1) invent a new product or create a new product; (2) attract customers; (3) manufacture a product; or (4) deliver a product. 15 It typically serves every customer in the same way. {width=\"6.5in\" height=\"4.685416666666667in\"} Summary Unit economics is about making sunk investments---primary sunk investments---where you are confident you can \"over-recover\" the investment to make a profit. When you start your business, it is critical to have defined your primary sunk investment, and the \"units\" its standardized process is designed to deliver. You must understand that the key attributes of these \"units of production\" are critical for satisfying the \"units of desire\" in your subset of customers, how many of these customers are likely to buy and what price they will pay. You then can calculate the variable and fixed period costs required to attract, make, and deliver these units, and how long it will take to recover your primary sunk investment and other start-up costs. All of business---from water pipelines to theme parks---is a matter of making and recovering sunk investments in a standardized set of processes. If you are clear about the \"units\" you are selling, and the primary sunk investment you have made, the chances are much higher that you will \"over recover\" your fixed and sunk costs and survive.","title":"The Art of Pricing Pt. 2"},{"location":"artofpricing2/#the-art-of-pricing-pt-2","text":"{width=\"6.5in\" height=\"2.6902777777777778in\"}","title":"The Art of Pricing Pt. 2"},{"location":"artofpricing2/#start-with-supply","text":"The danger of this \"build it and they will come\" approach is that it often encourages people to build businesses that never attract customers.

In Unit Economics, you learn to correctly define the sunk investments and fixed costs your venture will require.

This is the highest possible price you could charge (because no one would buy it after that). Measure your costs per unit. (Costs can vary depending on volume, but we'll get to that later. For now, choose a volume and measure cost per unit at that volume). The difference between the max value and the cost per unit is the \"shared value,\" because it's the total value of the product that must get divided up between you and the customer. Decide how much of the shared value you want to keep to yourself and how much you will give to the customer. Your price will be based on how much value you want to keep and concede. All of this works beautifully, until one little problem arises: a competing product or substitute of the same value starts selling for less. With no apparent difference in the value received by the customer, no customer will pay more for your product. So your new ceiling price is the price of the substitute.

Too many would-be entrepreneurs believe, \"If I build it, they will come.\" Following this self-centered strategy yields a high probability of pouring lots of money into a dark hole. A master entrepreneur takes every opportunity to observe the buying habits of potential customers and tries to form hypotheses about their motives. This leads to questions that help you dig more deeply into the emotions and habits that drive buying behavior. Even carefully crafted and deeply probing questions have their limits. Some customers refuse to tell you the truth. Others change their minds. Many cannot articulate why they buy what they do. The best way to get inside a customer\\'s shoes is to design experiments that help you predict buyer behavior before you sink large amounts of money into irretrievable investments such as factories or direct sales forces.

What does that mean? It means focusing on every single customer and every single unit sold. It's simple: You need revenue and you need it now---you've got fixed-period costs (FPC) like rent and payroll to cover. And in order to cover those costs effectively, you've got to get the price right. Ask yourself, \"Am I attracting an inferior group of customers who are trained to ask for discounts?\" And, \"How will discounts like these affect contribution to my fixed-period costs and my progress toward breakeven?\" Having to say \"no\" to any sale this early is---obviously---tough. But it's necessary. And think about this, too: How's the temptation to discount a symptom of a larger problem? Is the real problem that you haven't found customers who are willing to pay for the value you provide? If so, that needs to be addressed now, before you go any farther. {width=\"6.5in\" height=\"1.94375in\"} Season Two: Shifting Focus to the Segments That Make a Market Now your pricing strategy must shift its focus from individual units and customers to segments: groups of customers who share common characteristics. Pricing is no longer a matter of your judgment on a case-by-case basis---you need more standardized policies that others can execute. Decision time: When you've divided customers into segments, which segment should you commit your pricing strategy? The one that will pay the most? The one that will buy the most? Both? Skim or penetrate? During startup, you priced high to reach breakeven quickly (or, in a less likely and more risky scenario, you priced low to attract lots of early customers to cover high fixed-period costs). But now it's time to decide what your pricing strategy will look like long term. Do you price high to skim the customer segments who place the highest value on your product, or do you price low to penetrate, to capture as much of the market as possible? Let's stick with the water example to illustrate. {width=\"3.597014435695538in\" Pricing High (Skimming) By pricing high, you'd capture most of the value in serving a single glass of water to the dying millionaire, but the price is far above the value (maximum benefit) perceived by the other segments, so you'll only sell one glass. Pricing Low (Penetrating) By pricing low, you'll need to sell as many units as possible across all the segments. But pricing low means giving the customers in segments A, B, and C a disproportionately large amount of the value added. {width=\"6.5in\" height=\"2.6180555555555554in\"} Why not just charge different segments different prices? Charging different customers different prices is easier if you are the only salesperson, making snap judgments about each customer. It becomes complicated and difficult to execute when you try to codify this judgment to pass along to salesman and other employees. An important tradeoff this season: early payout or long-term profits? Season two is about making strategic decisions, one segment at a time. But reaching these segments---to advertise and educate them about the benefits of your product---often requires expensive investments in marketing and direct-sales forces, which in turn means charging higher prices to fund these efforts. But, at the same time, you want to keep prices low to encourage more early trial. But, without massive volume, pricing low might not give you the cash you need to encourage early trial to begin with. But pricing low and spending a great deal on marketing means risking large amounts of money to fund losses on a product that may never sell enough units to reach breakeven or payout. Likewise, pricing high and not investing in sales and marketing may lead to failure because uneducated customers are unwilling to pay a high price for unknown benefits [The bottom line? As you segment and price, be sure to account for the time and money it'll take to reach those segments.]{.underline} {width=\"6.5in\" height=\"1.9972222222222222in\"} So, price aside, how should you go about segmenting? You could approach segmenting in two different ways: 1) by focusing your portfolio of products and services and how they satisfy customers in various ways, or 2) by targeting the customer buying experience Segmenting by Products and Services Customer needs usually fall into the following categories. Ask yourself how your product or services stacks up in each: Performance. How well does your product or service deliver on particular promises in ways that can be measured? Image. How does it change the way customers feel about themselves? Risk. Does the buyer face any risk by purchasing your product? If so, how can this be lowered or eliminated? Simplicity. Is your product easy to understand? Convenience and availability. Is it easy to find and buy? The Customer Buying Experience Another way to segment is through the way a customer buys and uses the product and service. For example, your customer's experience with your product is likely to include the following steps: Research, costing, pricing, and planning a purchase Purchasing/ordering Delivery Use Billing Post-sale services No matter how well you segment your customers, soon competitors will begin to court those at the margins, those who don't quite \"fit.\" The next section describes how to adapt your products and strategies when---and hopefully before---competitors come knocking. Season Three: Maturity and Beyond It's no longer about the unit-by-unit, customer-by-customer focus of startup. And it's no longer just about segmenting. You're now at a precarious juncture when it comes to pricing. With competitors and substitutes in the mix, your products or services will begin to feel the magnetic tug toward commoditization---despite how good and unique you think your products portfolio is. You could begin discounting to regain or maintain customers who are beginning to look elsewhere. But you faced a similar dilemma about discounting during startup, didn't you? It's time to take action. And that means revisiting your pricing and segmenting strategies. The risk of marginal pricing There are at least three ways to resist commoditization and having to price low, almost all of which require re-segmenting customers and products and ranking them based on profitability. Rank customers based on profitability You can calculate the profitability of each customer, or even each order, if you look for situations where you are delivering a high benefit for a low price. Either raise prices on these already high-profit customers or target more of them. And most importantly, \"fire\" the low profitability customers to make way for more profitable customers. This way you won't have to add capacity. Refocus your sales on these more desirable customers: get close to them, build and renew trust, provide them with more and more complex and important offerings. Rank products and orders based on profitability You can also look more closely at the buying process. Which of your products is providing the most customer value, and where in its purchase cycle is the value the highest? Once identified, improve upon those best products and perfect the stages of the buying process that carry the most value. Bring up to speed the stages that bring the lowest value. And always try to move to deliver more for less Remember: Pricing is not a matter of deciding what amount you want to demand for a product or service, but a matter of creating and sharing value with customers. You want to constantly look for ways to create more value, not quibble over negotiating for a smaller and smaller share of a shrinking value pie. Rank channels based on profitability Which channels are bringing the most profit and growth? Rank your most profitable with your least---like you did with customer segments---and focus on expanding the most profitable ones. Watch out: If increasing sales are coming from a low-margin channel like Walmart, soon average profits as a percentage of revenues will start to decline {width=\"6.5in\" height=\"2.066666666666667in\"} Summary Your pricing strategy changes throughout the entrepreneurial seasons. In the startup season, pricing is a matter of talking customer by customer and measuring unit by unit the contribution that is made toward fixed-period costs, all in a frantic effort to reach breakeven. If you reach breakeven, the role of pricing changes. Now you have gathered enough data on different customer segments to decide which segments to pursue and in what order. Your goals shift from mere survival to accelerating payout and maximizing profits (which often are in conflict) and you now group individual customers into segments, so you can develop standardized processes and routines to serve them more efficiently. These processes and routines---built segment by segment through trial and error---will become the source of your competitive advantage: your differentiation. In the final season, you will face the entropy of success: Complacency. Too much complexity. Growing overhead. Once again it is time to refocus customer by customer, product by product, experience by experience to look for areas to add a great deal of value, for as little cost as possible.","title":"Pricing Strategies & The Seasons of Entrepreneurship"},{"location":"pricingseasons/#pricing-strategies-the-seasons-of-entrepreneurship","text":"","title":"Pricing Strategies &amp; The Seasons of Entrepreneurship"},{"location":"pricingseasons/#season-one-startup","text":"In startup season, just remaining in business is Priority One.

And in order to cover those costs effectively, you've got to get the price right. Ask yourself, \"Am I attracting an inferior group of customers who are trained to ask for discounts?\" And, \"How will discounts like these affect contribution to my fixed-period costs and my progress toward breakeven?\" Having to say \"no\" to any sale this early is---obviously---tough.

Calculate the average cost of making each sale and acquiring each customer. Gauge the quality of prospects you attract, quantify the cost of each step of the sales process and note the number of potential customers who drop out at every step, so it becomes clear where you need to focus your efforts to improve your sales process. Sales Funnels vs. Production Lines Assembly lines are about doing the right thing. Sales funnels are about asking the right questions, offering the right choices, watching what customers do, and praying they decide to buy in the end. Just How Difficult is it to Predict Customer Behavior? The actions of human beings are hard to predict and influence, but if you break down a sales process into discrete steps, pay close attention to why some prospects are more likely to close than others, and measure how many prospects defect at each step, you can begin to make the sales process more predictable. The Value of a Quick \"No\" The only thing better than a quick \"yes\" in sales is a quick \"no.\" A quick \"no\" from a disinterested prospect frees you up to search for a customer who truly needs what you are offering. The worst type of prospect is one that takes up an inordinate amount of your time and, only after a great deal of time, attention, and money has been spent, decides not to buy. {width=\"4.72619094488189in\" height=\"4.199543963254593in\"} Building a Sales Funnel The Major Questions for Sales Funnel Design The design of your sales process will depend on whether your customers are: easy or hard to find, eager or reluctant to buy, and worth a lot or a little to close. Customers who are easy to find, eager to buy, and valuable to close are an entrepreneur's dream. Customers who are difficult to find, hard to convince, and of little value to close are an entrepreneur's nightmare. It is with the \"in-between\" customers that the right sales process can make the difference between success and failure. The Major Decisions in Sales Funnel Design Do you want to grow quickly or slowly? Will your campaign be broad or targeted? Will you have an intense sales effort to convince prospects to buy, or a more restrained approach? Will you go to your customer, or have them come to you? Will you take all comers, or be selective about the customers you choose? What Is the Difference between a Lead, a Prospect, and a Qualified Prospect? Unfortunately, we cannot tell from outward appearance when a customer moves from being a lead---someone who is mildly curious---to being a prospect who is more likely to close. We can ask our customers questions, but they do not always answer truthfully and often change their minds. Staging Investments We need to test as many sales funnel alternatives as possible before committing to large upfront and fixed-period costs. Your initial estimates will likely be wrong. That is why it is important to stage, test, and carefully monitor the yield and costs at each step of the process. The longer your sales cycle and the faster you intend to grow, the more important it is to collect data early in the process so that you can adapt quickly Sizing the Funnel Once you've estimated how your sales cycle, the average costs per sale, and the capacity of the funnel varies for different sales funnel arrangements, you can compare your estimates of how quickly sales will increase to the overall size of the market. You'll want to size the sales funnel so that you attract customers quickly enough to discourage competitors from entering your niche, but recover all of your costs and make a healthy profit before you run out of prospects. Some Tips on the Sales Process It is generally much cheaper to sort and qualify customers who are interested in buying than to try to interest and persuade customers (changing minds is expensive). Each additional step in a sales funnel adds an exponential amount of complexity and cost. Communications and handoffs from one step in the process to another are expensive and difficult to execute. Targeted approaches tend to work better than broad approaches. Convincing customers to come to you is usually far more effective than having to go to them. Summary Designing and building a sales funnel is much more difficult than designing an assembly line. Using machines to cut and shape widgets is much easier than attracting, informing, sorting, and closing finicky potential customers. The difficulty involved makes it even more important to design a sales funnel that fits with the type of customer we want to attract and the benefits we offer. Each time we spend money to attract, sort, or convince customers, we must measure the number and quality of the prospects that move to the next step. That way, over time, we will learn to predict how to turn customers' needs into revenue as quickly as possible, at the lowest possible cost per sale, and to recover the costs of our sales funnel long before we run out of potential customers.","title":"The Sales Funnel"},{"location":"salesfunnel/#the-sales-funnel","text":"","title":"The Sales Funnel"},{"location":"salesfunnel/#3-ways-a-sales-funnel-can-help","text":"Predict how sales calls today will impact revenue later.

Two Choices: Design and create a Sales Funnel A series of steps to attract, qualify, educate, and close customers. Create A WOM movement To work hard to delight your first few customers, so that these early converts begin a Word of Mouth (WOM) movement that results in exploding revenues. A sales funnel sounds like a lot of work, but more scientific and predictable. A word of mouth approach sounds like more fun and potentially much more lucrative, but harder to predict. So which is better for your business? The short answer: It depends. {width=\"3.592600612423447in\" height=\"1.8690474628171478in\"} {width=\"4.013888888888889in\" height=\"2.6805555555555554in\"} The Benefits and Drawbacks of Sales Funnels and Word of Mouth Sales funnels When well built and implemented, provide a systematic approach to increasing revenues. Under the right conditions, every step of the process can be tested to see which messages and techniques increase close rates, add to customer satisfaction, or decrease costs. The drawbacks They're expensive to design and operate and, when done poorly, may make customers feel more like widgets on a factory assembly line than highly valued individuals. And the only way to increase sales is to pump more and better leads into the start of the funnel. Sales funnels tend to work better for higher-priced functional products or simple image-based ones, where benefits can be explained and reluctant customers discarded at each step along the way. Word of Mouth (WOM) Has the advantage of rapid, often exponential sales growth, at a very low cost. Plus, done properly, customers may begin to develop a deep sense of belonging, making it hard for competitors to lure them away. Word of mouth is easy to recognize and fun to talk about, but unfortunately it's very hard to execute deliberately. In practice, it's difficult to ignite the right spark and keep enthusiasm at consistently high levels from one generation of customers to the next, because the technique depends largely on the emotions of crowds and societal trends. Word of mouth sales also tend to work better for more complex \"image\" or \"identity\" products and services, or for faddish impulse items than for more mundane, functional products. How Do You Create and Execute a Successful Word of Mouth Campaign? Start with a product that involves image or identity element of image or belonging---they say something about who you are, and they describe deep, important issues that you want to share with your \"tribe.\" Create a message that's memorable and \"sticky\" so it spreads easily. a. It is simple \"Get it there.\" b. It surprises you; it is unexpected Tom's Shoes promises to donate a pair to a child in need. c. Concreteness Your senses are excited. Emotional words lead to something you can feel and touch d. Credibility There are powerful testimonials from people who do not have any conflicts of interest. e. Emotions You are touched deeply, often with a positive feeling like hope or gratitude f. Story There is a simple, powerful, often redemptive, story Delight all your customers---capture, affirm, and arm the evangelical ones g. Connectors know lots of people and enjoy bringing them together in constructive ways h. Mavens are experts. They specialize in collecting and sharing information i. Salespeople are persuaders. They convince people to take risks, to try something j. they wouldn't ordinarily try Keep the conversation going -- make them feel valued part of a new movement and an important part of enlisting others in the cause k. Once a customer engages, ask him or her for advice, and show that you take their ideas seriously and that you put those ideas to work. l. Ask them to test and provide feedback on new products. m. Even ask for suggestions for new products to introduce Provide incentives, but be careful not to try to purchase loyalty. Have strong \"we believe\" statements. Measure the right markers n. Track what percentage of your customers says \"yes\" to the question, \"Would you recommend this product or service to a friend?\" o. Measure how many new customers come from referrals. p. Count the number of new product ideas submitted by customers. The right timing helps---a lot. Great stories and deep emotions are timeless. But context helps immensely too To spark powerful WOM Have an amazing and useful product or service Have fierce passion for that product or service and for letting those who can benefit from it know about it. Seth Godin's 4 Principle's No matter how exactly you plan to execute, keep these basic principles from Seth Godin in mind. Transparency Your customers aren't stupid. If they think for a second that you're being inauthentic about your passion for your product or service (and why should you be, really?), they'll bolt. A movement bigger than you. How does your product or service help change the world in a significant way? Movements that grow, thrive. WOM is about more that short-term tactics. How is today part of a growing, dynamic tomorrow? Exclude outsiders. How well have you chosen your customers and followers so that you don't expend wasted effort elsewhere? Which Is Better---Sales Funnel or WOM Campaign? So which is it? The truth is---you need them both. {width=\"6.5in\" height=\"2.071527777777778in\"} WOM campaigns sound exciting, but they're usually too unreliable and unpredictable of a technique on which to bet your future. That means that once you find the right customer niche, you need a well-designed sales funnel: a repeatable, scalable process that gives you a higher probability of surviving startup and the early years of the launch phase. But if you have the right products, and sense the spark of delighted customers who want to tell their friends, it'd be foolish not to try to fan these sparks into a WOM wildfire that could turn your best customers not only into a free sales force, but into a tribe that no competitor could lead astray.

And the only way to increase sales is to pump more and better leads into the start of the funnel. Sales funnels tend to work better for higher-priced functional products or simple image-based ones, where benefits can be explained and reluctant customers discarded at each step along the way.","title":"The drawbacks"},{"location":"saleswom/#word-of-mouth-wom","text":"Has the advantage of rapid, often exponential sales growth, at a very low cost. Plus, done properly, customers may begin to develop a deep sense of belonging, making it hard for competitors to lure them away. Word of mouth is easy to recognize and fun to talk about, but unfortunately it's very hard to execute deliberately. In practice, it's difficult to ignite the right spark and keep enthusiasm at consistently high levels from one generation of customers to the next, because the technique depends largely on the emotions of crowds and societal trends. Word of mouth sales also tend to work better for more complex \"image\" or \"identity\" products and services, or for faddish impulse items than for more mundane, functional products.","title":"Word of Mouth (WOM)"},{"location":"saleswom/#how-do-you-create-and-execute-a-successful-word-of-mouth-campaign","text":"Start with a product that involves image or identity element of image or belonging---they say something about who you are, and they describe deep, important issues that you want to share with your \"tribe.\" Create a message that's memorable and \"sticky\" so it spreads easily. a.

Once a customer engages, ask him or her for advice, and show that you take their ideas seriously and that you put those ideas to work. l. Ask them to test and provide feedback on new products. m.

That means that once you find the right customer niche, you need a well-designed sales funnel: a repeatable, scalable process that gives you a higher probability of surviving startup and the early years of the launch phase. But if you have the right products, and sense the spark of delighted customers who want to tell their friends, it'd be foolish not to try to fan these sparks into a WOM wildfire that could turn your best customers not only into a free sales force, but into a tribe that no competitor could lead astray.
