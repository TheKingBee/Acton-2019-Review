**Do we have attractive customers?**| **Should we move forward aggressively or carefully?** | **Simple/small or large/complex sales funnel or word of mouth?** | **Do we hire hunter, gatherer, or farmer salespeople? How do we compensate?** 
|Is the customer need intense or trivial? | Are there clear segments and a large market or not? | Simple/small or large complex sales funnel or word of mouth? | Is industry experience or raw talent more important?
Are customers easy or hard to find? | Is this a large investment or a small investment? | Do we need to close few or many customers? | Do we hire and train from within or recruit?
Are customers easy or hard to lure away?| Does this product require a short or long sales cycle? | Will customers recruit or mobilize new customers?| Do we need Hunter, Gatherer, or Farmer salespeople?
Are there few or many substitutes? | Are we facing aggressive or benign competition? | Is gaining interest, communicating benefits,qualifying, closing, or service most critical? | Reward with money or with praise/recognition?
Is it easy or hard to communicate the benefit? | Do we move quickly or move slowly?| |Pay when orders are booked or when accounts are settled?
Is this solution low risk to try or high risk to try? | Do we price high or price low?| | Pay in Salary, bonus, or commission? Capped or unlimited?
