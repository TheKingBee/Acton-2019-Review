# Introduction To Customers

## Introduction

All other tasks in a business pale in comparison to the need to create and retain customers. The single most important step in launching an entrepreneurial venture is finding, attracting, qualifiying, and close customers who have intense, unmet needs.

Therefore, the overarching question of the Customers Tools course is:

**How do you identify, listen to and segement customers; price products and services; and busines a sales funnel to close the right customers, at the right time, in sufficient quanitities, at as low a cost per sale and with as small an upfront investment as possible?**
